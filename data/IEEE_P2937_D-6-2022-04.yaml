abstract:
- content: Artificial intelligence (AI) computing differs from generic computing in
    terms of devices’ formation, operators, and usage. AI server systems, including
    AI server, cluster, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures are designed
    specifically for this purpose. The performance of these infrastructures is important
    to users not only on generic models but the ones for specific domains. This standard
    provides formal methods for the performance benchmarking for AI server systems?including
    approaches for test, metrics and measure. In addition, this specification provides
    the technical requirements on tools for benchmarking.
