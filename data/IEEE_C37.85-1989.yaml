abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the maximum permissible X-radiation emission from
    alternating-current high-voltage power vacuum interrupters that are intended to
    be operated at voltages between 5000 volts and 38 000 volts when tested in accordance
    with procedures described in this standard.
