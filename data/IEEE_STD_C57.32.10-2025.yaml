abstract:
- content: The applications, selection principles, technical requirements, and test
    requirements for dry type and liquid-immersed neutral-grounding devices used with
    high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converter transformers are discussed. HVDC
    converter transformers with a star-connected winding on the grid side and a delta-connected
    winding on the valve side are applicable to this guide.
