abstract:
- content: This guide explains the cable requirements for enclosed transit infrastructure
    in the USA and Canada. It focuses on public underground systems for passenger
    transport, such as metro tunnels and stations. It discusses the adoption of the
    NFPA 130-2023 standard by transit authorities and wire and cable requirements
    for different applications. The guide does not address open/above ground transit
    infrastructure, rolling stock, or railway vehicles. It details considerations
    by NFPA 130-2023 for flame propagation, smoke release, and circuit-integrity.
    Various cable types including general purpose, fire-resistive, train signaling,
    traction power, communication, and antenna cables are discussed. Emphasis is placed
    on compliance with NRTL Listings such as wet ratings, conductor temperature ratings,
    and flame propagation standards.
