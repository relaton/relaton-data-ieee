abstract:
- content: Requirements and specifications for using blockchain for green power identification
    applications are specified in this standard. A technical framework for the planning,
    design, construction, and operation of green power identification systems is described.
    The purpose is to improve the efficiency of system interactions, perform life
    cycle traceability management of green power identification applications, and
    enhance the efficiency of multi-subject identity authentication for green power
    identification, thereby improving business efficiency.
