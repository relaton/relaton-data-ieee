abstract:
- content: 'An abstraction layer for multiple home networking technologies that provides
    a common interface to widely deployed home networking technologies is defined
    in this standard: IEEE 1901 over power lines, IEEE 802.11 for wireless, Ethernet
    over twisted pair cable, and MoCA 1.1 over coax. Additional network technologies
    are supported by an extensible mechanism using an IEEE OUI and XML formatted document.
    Connectivity selection for transmission of packets arriving from any interface
    or application is supported by the 1905.1 abstraction layer. Modification to the
    underlying home networking technologies is not required by the 1905.1 abstraction
    layer, and hence it does not change the behavior or implementation of existing
    home networking technologies. The 1905 abstraction layer between is layers 2 and
    3 and abstracts the individual details of each interface, aggregates available
    bandwidth, and facilitates seamless integration. The 1905 abstraction layer also
    facilitates end-to-end quality of service (QoS) while simplifying the introduction
    of new devices to the network, establishing secure connections, extending network
    coverage, and facilitating advanced network management features including discovery,
    path selection, auto configuration, and quality of service (QoS) negotiation.'
