abstract:
- content: Defined in this standard is the general process of cryptocurrency payment
    between consumers and merchants. This process describes how a consumer purchases
    goods or services with cryptocurrency and how the merchant receives fiat money
    in return. It involves multiple aspects such as cryptocurrency payment operators
    playing an agent role, consumers owning cryptocurrency, merchant accessing to
    a cryptocurrency payment platform, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges.
