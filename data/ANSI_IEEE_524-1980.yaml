abstract:
- content: This guide provides general recommendations for the selection of methods,
    equipment and tools that have been found practical for the stringing of overhead
    transmission line conductors and overhead ground-wires. The guide also includes
    a comprehensive list of definitions for equipment and tools used in stringing
    and for stringing terms commonly employed. This guide is broad enough yet specific
    enough to be applicable to the stringing conductors of all sizes. The practices
    that are described provide for continuous control of the conductor from the initial
    setup to the ready for service condition.
