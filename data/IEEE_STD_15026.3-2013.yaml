abstract:
- content: The concept of integrity levels with corresponding integrity level requirements
    that arerequired to be met in order to show the achievement of the integrity level
    are specified in thisadoption of ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011. It places requirements
    on and recommends methods fordefining and using integrity levels and their integrity
    level requirements, including the assignmentof integrity levels to systems, software
    products, their elements, and relevant externaldependences.
