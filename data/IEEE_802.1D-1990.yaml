abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 802.1D-1998 An architecture for the interconnection
    of IEEE 802&#174; Local Area Networks (LANs) below the MAC Service boundary is
    defined. MAC Bridges, as specified by this standard, allow communications between
    end stations attached to separate LANs, each with its own separate MAC, to be
    transparent to logical link control (LLC) and network layer protocols, just as
    if the stations were attached to the same LAN.
