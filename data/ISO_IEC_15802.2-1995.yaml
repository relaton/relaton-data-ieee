abstract:
- content: Services and protocol elements that permit the exchange of management information
    between stations attached to ISO/IEC standard local and metropolitan area networks
    are defined.The standard includes the specification of managed objects that permit
    the operation of the protocolelements to be remotely managed. In addition, an
    architecture for station discovery and the dynamiccontrol of event forwarding
    is defined. Services and protocols that support station discovery andthe dynamic
    control of event forwarding are defined. (Incorporating ANSI/IEEE Stds 802.1B-1992
    and 802.1k-1993)
