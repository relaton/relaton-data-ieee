abstract:
- content: This recommeded practice provides a single source of component function
    identifiers which, along with related recommended practices concerning unique
    identification principles and definitions, implementation instructions, and system
    descriptions, makes up a concept, entitled the Energy Industry Identification
    System (EIIS), for uniquely identifying systems, structures, and components of
    nuclear and fossil fueld power plant projects (electric power generating stations)
    and realted facilities. Hydro and other types of power plant projects are not
    included in this issue.
