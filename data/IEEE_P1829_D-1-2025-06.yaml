abstract:
- content: This guide establishes uniform procedures for the testing of transmission
    line and station bus hardware assemblies in high voltage (&#x003E;100 kV) laboratories.
    Two tests are described. The first one is a corona performance test. The second
    is a radio interference voltage (RIV) test. The first test uses visible techniques
    to determine the onset of positive corona. The second test is a measurement of
    the RIV voltage according to ANSI C63.2 or CISPR 16-1-1 and CISPR 18-2. This guide
    does not address the permissible radio interference (RI) limits or specified corona
    extinction voltages. They are set either by regulation or by agreement between
    the end user and hardware manufacturer.
