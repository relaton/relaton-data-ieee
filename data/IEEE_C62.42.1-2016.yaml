abstract:
- content: 'Covered in the IEEE C62.42 guide series are surge protective components
    (SPCs) used in power and telecom surge protective devices (SPDs) and equipment
    ports. Covered in this standard on gas discharge tube (GDT) technology SPCs are
    the following: component construction, characteristics, ratings, and application
    examples. The application examples are given in two informative annexes covering:
    basic circuits and protection circuits specific to communications, local area
    networks, high frequency feeds, and industrial services.'
