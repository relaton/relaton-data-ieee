abstract:
- content: This amendment is part of the POSIX series of standards for applications
    and user interfaces to open systems. It defines the applications interface to
    basic system services for input/output, file system access, and process management.
    It also defines a format for data interchange. When options specified in the Realtime
    Extension are included, the standard also defines interfaces appropriate for realtime
    applications.
