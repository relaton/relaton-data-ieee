abstract:
- content: The media access control characteristics for the demand-priority access
    method are specified. The layer management, physical layers, and media that support
    this access method are also specified. Layer and sublayer interface specifications
    are aligned to the ISO Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model and
    ISO/IEC 8802 models. Specifications for 100 Mb/s operation over 100 /spl Omaga/
    balanced cable (twisted-pair) Categories 3 through 5, 150 /spl Omaga/ shielded
    balanced cable, and fibre-optic media are included. Optional implementation of
    redundant links to facilitate automatic recovery of network connectivity in case
    of link or repeater failure anywhere in the network path is specified. Rules for
    connecting redundant links within a network are defined.
