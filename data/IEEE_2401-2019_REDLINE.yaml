abstract:
- content: A method is provided for specifying a common interoperable format for electronic
    systems design. The format provides a common way to specify information/data about
    the project management, netlists, components, design rules, and geometries used
    in the large-scale integration-package-board designs. The method provides the
    ability to make electronic systems a key consideration early in the design process;
    design tools can use it to seamlessly exchange information/data.
