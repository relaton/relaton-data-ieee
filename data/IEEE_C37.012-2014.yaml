abstract:
- content: Guidance for the application of ac high-voltage circuit breakers is provided.
    The application guide addresses the general theory of capacitance current switching;
    and the notions of restrike, re-ignition, non-sustained disruptive discharge (NSDD).
    Voltage factors used for single-phase testing as substitute for three-phase testing
    are explained. Application of circuit breakers for different network conditions
    and different capacitive loads (capacitor banks, cables, transmission lines, and
    filter banks) is treated.
