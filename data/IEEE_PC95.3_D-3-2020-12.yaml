abstract:
- content: Best practices are described for the development, validation, and application
    of methods for the computation and measurement of relevant metrics characterizing
    human exposure to electric and/or magnetic fields (collectively, electromagnetic
    fields) over the frequency range of 0 Hz to 300 GHz. This recommended practice
    is a replacement for IEEE Std C95.3&#8482;-2002 and IEEE Std C95.3.1&#8482;-2010,
    extensively revising the contents from those and harmonizing with IEEE Std C95.1&#8482;-2019.
    Detailed methodology is not described; rather, requirements for best practice
    are expressed through guidance and references to other documents and standards.
    Examples are included to clarify the guidance. This recommended practice is intended
    for professional users who are familiar with basic electromagnetic field theory
    and practice and for persons involved in specifying or implementing critical hazard
    assessments or surveys such as those described in IEEE Std C95.7&#8482;-2014.
