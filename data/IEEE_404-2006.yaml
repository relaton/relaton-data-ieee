abstract:
- content: Electrical ratings and test requirements of cable joints used with extruded
    and laminated dielectric shielded cable rated in preferred voltage steps from
    2500 V to 500 000 V are established in this standard. In addition, test requirements
    for cable jacket and cable shield restoration devices are defined. A variety of
    common joint constructions are also defined. This standard has been designed to
    provide uniform testing procedures that can be used by manufacturers and users
    to evaluate the ability of underground power cable joints, and associated cable
    shield and cable jacket restoration components, to perform reliably in service.
