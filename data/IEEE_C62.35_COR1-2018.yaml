abstract:
- content: Avalanche breakdown diodes used for surge protection on systems with voltages
    equal to or less than 1000 V rms or 1200 V dc are discussed in this standard.
    The avalanche breakdown diode surge suppressor is a semiconductor diode that can
    operate in either the forward or reverse direction of its V-I characteristic.
    This component is a single package, which may be assembled from any combination
    of series and/or parallel diode chips. This standard contains definitions, service
    conditions, and a series of test criteria for determining the electrical characteristics
    and verifying ratings of these avalanche breakdown diodes. If the characteristics
    differ with the direction of conduction, then each direction of conduction shall
    be separately specified.
