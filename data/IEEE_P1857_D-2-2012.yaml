abstract:
- content: In this standard, a set of tools for efficient video coding is defined,
    including directional intra prediction, variable block size inter prediction and
    context adaptive binary arithmetic coding, and the corresponding decoding procedure.
    The target applications and services include but not limited TV over Internet,
    user-generated multimedia content, IP-based video conference, IP-based surveillance,
    and otherre video/audio enabled services and applications such as digital television
    broadcasting, digital storage media, and communication.
