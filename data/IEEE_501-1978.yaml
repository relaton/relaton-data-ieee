abstract:
- content: This is a standard for developing data related to the seismic capabilities
    of relays. This standard compliments ANSI/IEEE Std 344-1975, Recommended Practices
    for Seismic Qualification of Class IE Equipment for Nuclear Power Generating Stations,
    which provides general guidelines for developing data related to seismic qualification
    of equipment used in nuclear generating plants. Data must be developed by testing
    rather than analytical means since protective relays fall into the category of
    complex devices as described in Section 5 of ANSI/IEEE Std 344-1975; however,
    analysis may be used in data reduction, in reconciling response spectra, in justifying
    methods of evaluating changes, and in justifying seismic qualifications of relays
    of similar construction. While aging is recognized as a potential influence on
    the seismic capability of relays, insufficient definition presently exists to
    permit realistic simulation of end-of-life for various relays. When applicable
    definition of the various degrading factors and methods of accelerating the effect
    of these factors is developed in other related standards, they should be considered
    in the previbration preparation. It should be emphasized that while a primary
    purpose in preparing this standard was to cover the application of relays to nuclear
    generating plants, the standard is not restricted to this application. This standard
    may be applied to any area in which the seismic response of relays is a design
    consideration.
