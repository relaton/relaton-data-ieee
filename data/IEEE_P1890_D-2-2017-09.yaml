abstract:
- content: A two-level code construction scheme for non-volatile memories (NVM) that
    is based on low-density parity-check codes is specified in this standard. This
    scheme constructs an auxiliary codeword that encodes a subset of bits from the
    primary packets stored in an NVM memory unit. The auxiliary codeword is decoded
    only when the detection of at least one of the primary codewords fails. The encoding
    and decoding techniques for this scheme are presented. The two-level scheme outperforms
    the traditional one-level method while it requires only a small memory overhead
    and negligible latency. Moreover, it outperforms the one-level scheme that uses
    a code that is twice as long in the low raw bit error rate regime.
