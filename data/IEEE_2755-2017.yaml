abstract:
- content: An all-new family of software-based intelligent process automation technologies
    has emerged recently. Because of the newness of this kind of automation capability,
    there are no common definitions of concepts, capabilities, terms, technology,
    types, etc. This standard is published for the purpose of promoting clarity and
    consistency in the use of Software Based Intelligent Process Automation (SBIPA)
    terminology. The definitions represent the consensus of a diverse panel of industry
    participants.
