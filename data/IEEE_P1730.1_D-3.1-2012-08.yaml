abstract:
- content: A recommended practice for applying the Distributed Simulation Engineering
    and Execution Process(DSEEP) to the development and execution of distributed simulation
    environments that include more than one distributed simulation architecture is
    described. Distributed simulation architectures to which the recommended practice
    applies include, but are not limited to, Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS),
    High Level Architecture (HLA), and Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).
    This product identifies and describes multi-architecture issues and provides recommended
    actions for simulation environment developers faced with those issues. This product
    also augments the DSEEP lists of inputs, recommended tasks, and outcomes, with
    additional inputs, recommended tasks, and outcomes that apply to multi-architecture
    simulation environments. This product is an overlay to the DSEEP, which is a separate
    recommended practice.
