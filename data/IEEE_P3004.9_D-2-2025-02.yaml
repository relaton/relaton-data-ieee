abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standard (Recommended Practice for the Protection of Transformers
    Used in Industrial and Commercial Power Systems) provides descriptions of essential
    aspects related to the protection of power transformers utilized in industrial
    and commercial power systems. These essential aspects include protection philosophy,
    protection system implementations, selection and practical application of protection
    functions, protection devices, protection device settings, protection logics,
    protection schemes, procedures and other associated recommended practices.
