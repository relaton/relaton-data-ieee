abstract:
- content: Information is provided to users and manufacturers of surge-protective
    devices (SPIDs) about the interactions that can occur between SPIDs and power
    system disturbances. This guide applies to SPIDs manufactured to be connected
    to 50 Hz or 60 Hz ac power circuits rated at 100-1000 V rms. The effects of the
    presence and operation of SPIDs on the quality of power available to the connected
    loads are described. The interaction between multiple SPIDs on the same circuit
    is also described
