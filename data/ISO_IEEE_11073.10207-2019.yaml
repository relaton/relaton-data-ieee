abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073&#8482; family of standards for
    point-of-care medical device communication, a Participant Model derived from the
    ISO/IEEE11073-10201 Domain Information Model is provided in this standard. The
    Participant Model specifies the structure of medical information objects. This
    standard also defines an abstract Communication Model to support the exchange
    of medical information objects. All elements of the Participant Model and Communication
    Model are specified using XML Schema. Core subjects of the Participant Model comprise
    modelling of medical device-related data, e.g., measurements and settings, alert
    systems, contextual information (e.g., patient demographics and location information),
    remote control, and archival information. Model extensibility is provided inherently
    through the use of XML Schema.
