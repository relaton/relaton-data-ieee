abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011, a service management system (SMS) standard, is adopted
    by the IEEE in this standard. It specifies requirements for the service provider
    to plan, establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve
    an SMS. The requirements include the design, transition, delivery, and improvement
    of services to fulfill agreed service requirements. This standard can be used
    by the following: 1) An organization seeking services from service providers and
    requiring assurance that their service requirements will be fulfilled. 2) An organization
    that requires a consistent approach by all its service providers, including those
    in a supply chain. 3) A service provider that intends to demonstrate its capability
    for the design, transition, delivery, and improvement of services that fulfill
    service requirements. 4) A service provider to monitor, measure, and review its
    service management processes and services. 5) A service provider to improve the
    design, transition, delivery, and improvement of services through the effective
    implementation and operation of the SMS. 6) An assessor or auditor as the criteria
    for a conformity assessment of a service provider''s SMS to the requirements in
    this standard.'
