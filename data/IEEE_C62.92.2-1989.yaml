abstract:
- content: 'General considerations for grounding synchronous generator systems are
    summarized, focusing on the objectives of generator grounding. The factors to
    be considered in the selection of a grounding class and the application of grounding
    methods are discussed. Four generator grounding types are considered: unit-connected
    generation systems, common-bus generators without feeders, generators with feeders
    directly connected at generated voltage, and three-phase, 4-wire connected generators.'
