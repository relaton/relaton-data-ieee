abstract:
- content: This guide aims to establish a standardized reference framework and technical
    protocols for implementing large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models in
    financial risk management. It serves as an essential guidance for financial institutions
    seeking to build, iterate, utilize their large-scale AI models for managing financial
    risks. The guide offers best practice on integrating various data knowledge, including
    feature space, sample, and model knowledge, into large-scale financial risk management
    models. It also provides strategic guidance on designing pre-training process,
    fine-tuning process, and evaluation methodologies to augment the feature and risk
    comprehensive capabilities of the large-scale models. Furthermore, it elucidates
    on the swift adaptation of the large models to various financial lending risk
    scenarios and the iterative process of the large-scale models.
