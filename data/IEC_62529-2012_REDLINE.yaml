abstract:
- content: Adoption of IEEE Std 1641-2010. This standard provides the means to define
    and describe signals used in testing. It also provides a set of common basic signals,
    built upon formal mathematical specifications so that signals can be combined
    to form complex signals usable across all test platforms.
