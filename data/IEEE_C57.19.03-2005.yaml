abstract:
- content: This corrigendum corrects IEEE Std C57.19.03-1996. The standard applies
    to outdoor and indoor power apparatus dc bushings of condenser type that have
    basic impulse insulation levels of 110 kV and above for use as components of oil-filled
    converter transformers and smoothing reactors, as well as air-to-air dc bushings.
    This standard defines the special terms used, service conditions, rating, general
    requirements, electrical insulation characteristics, and test procedure for the
    bushings for dc application
