abstract:
- content: A practical basis is provided for the selection of voltage and current
    tests to be applied in evaluating the surge withstand capability of equipment
    connected to utility power circuits, primarily in residential, commercial, and
    light industrial applications. The recommended practice covers the origin of surge
    voltages, rate of occurrence and voltage levels in unprotected circuits, waveshapes
    of representative surge voltages, energy, and source and impedance. Three locations
    categories are defined according to their relative position from the building
    service entrance. For each category, representative waveforms of surge voltages
    and surge currents are described, organized in two recommended “standard waveforms”
    and three suggested “additional waveforms.”
