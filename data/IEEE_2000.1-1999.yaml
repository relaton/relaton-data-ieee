abstract:
- content: This standard revises IEEE Std 2000.1-1998. It provides a detailed set
    of definitions. Inaddition, it addresses calendar information that is helpful
    in understanding the timeline issues surrounding the year 2000 rollover. The definitions
    section remains the core of the standard. With this expanded set of definitions,
    the standard now addresses areas that are relevant to both engineering and business
    environments. An increased degree of specificity has been added to the definition
    of Year 2000 compliance,making it more precise in its meaning and application.
