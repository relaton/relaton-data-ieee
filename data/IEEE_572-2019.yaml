abstract:
- content: Basic requirements, direction, and methods for qualifying Class lE connection
    assemblies for service in nuclear power generating stations and other nuclear
    facilities are provided in this standard. These requirements include connectors,
    terminations, and environmental seals in combination with related cables or wires
    as assemblies. Qualification of cable with connectors to this standard does not
    replace qualification to IEEE Std 383&#x2122;-2015. This standard does not apply
    to containment electric penetrations, fire stops, in-line splices, components
    for service within the reactor vessel, or fiber optic connectors. (Refer to IEEE
    Std 1682&#x2122;-2011.) The qualification requirements in this standard, when
    met, demonstrate and document the ability of the equipment to perform safety function(s)
    under applicable service conditions (including design basis events) reducing the
    risks of common cause equipment failures. This standard does not provide environmental
    stress levels and performance requirements.
