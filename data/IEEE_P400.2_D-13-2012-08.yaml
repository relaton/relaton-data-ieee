abstract:
- content: This guide describes very low frequency (VLF) withstand and other diagnostic
    tests and measurements that are performed using VLF energization in the field
    on shielded power cable systems. Whenever possible, cable systems are treated
    in a similar manner to individual cables. Tables are included as an aid to identifying
    the effectiveness of the VLF ac voltage test for various cable system insulation
    problems.
