abstract:
- content: 'Measures that may be taken to help mitigate tank rupture of energized
    liquid-immersed power transformers and reactors due to internal electrical faults
    are described in this guide. The release of insulating fluid or insulating fluid
    mist due to failure of the following components are not covered in this guide:
    load tap changer compartments, bushings and their turrets, conservator tank, piping,
    valves, pumps, and radiators.'
