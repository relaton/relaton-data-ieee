abstract:
- content: 'Test methods and performance criteria for plug-in (portable) multiservice
    (multiport) surge protective devices (MSPDs) intended to protect equipment connected
    to one or more metallic conductive telecommunication line(s) and a 120 V/240 V
    single phase two-wire (line and neutral) ac power service, with the neutral grounded
    at the service equipment are defined in this standard. Performance testing covers
    three areas: the ac power SPD section, the telecommunication SPD section, and
    the MSPD as whole. Essential MSPD performance characteristics are the reduction
    of surge current in the equipment ground loops and surge coupling between the
    individual SPD sections.'
