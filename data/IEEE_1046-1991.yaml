abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Feb 06, 2006. Alternate approaches
    to applying a digital control system, for both new construction and existing plant
    modernization projects, are described, and their advantages and disadvantages
    are compared. Criteria to be used to judge the suitability of commercially available
    systems for use in the power generation industry are provided. Terminology is
    defined, and the objectives of distributed control and monitoring systems are
    described. The following system application issues are addressed: integrated versus
    segregated systems functional and geographic distribution, hierarchical architecture
    and automation, control and protection functions, input/output systems, environmental
    considerations, and documentation. The data communications structure and the functions
    that support it are considered. Data acquisition and monitoring (the man/machine
    interfaces) are discussed. Reliability, availability, and fault tolerance of distributed
    control and monitoring systems are addressed.'
