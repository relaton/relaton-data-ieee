abstract:
- content: The user of underground cables is provided with information on the design,
    testing, and application of moisture-impervious, medium-voltage, solid dielectric
    power cable using metal-plastic laminates as moisture barriers. Information is
    also provided on selection of jacketing materials and installation practices.
    Other types of moisture barriers, such as extruded metal sheaths and bare metallic
    tapes with sealed seams, are beyond the scope of this guide.
