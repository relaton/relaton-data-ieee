abstract:
- content: The main emphasis of this recommended practice is the engineering design
    of optical fiber communication facilities serving, or connected to, electric supply
    locations. This document includes methods for providing telecommunication facilities
    serving electric supply locations using optical fiber cables, and their related
    electronic systems, extending across the zone of influence (ZOI). (IEEE Std 1590&#8482;-2009
    in its entirety, was replaced by IEEE Std 487.2 and IEEE Std 487.3.)
