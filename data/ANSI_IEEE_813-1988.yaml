abstract:
- content: 'A format guide for the preparation of a two-degree-of-freedom dynamically
    tuned gyro (DTG) specification is given that provides a common ground of terminology
    and practice for manufacturers and users. A compilation of recommended procedures
    for testing a DTG is also given. The requirements and test procedures are defined
    in terms unique to the DTG. They cover applications of the gyro as an angular
    motion sensor in navigation and control systems. They apply to two modes of use:
    (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments typical of aircraft and missile
    applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform applications in which
    the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected are benign relative
    to the accuracy required. In the case of the strap-down DTG, the characteristics
    of the external capture loops are considered to the extent necessary to define
    the gyro performance.'
