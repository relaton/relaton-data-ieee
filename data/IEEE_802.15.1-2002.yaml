abstract:
- content: 'This IEEE Standards product is part of the 802 family on LAN/MAN. Abstract:
    The lower transport layers [(Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP),
    Link Manager Protocol (LMP), baseband, and radio] of the Bluetooth&#8482; wireless
    technology are defined. Bluetooth is an industry specification for short-range
    radio frequency (RF)-based connectivity for portable personal devices. The IEEE
    802.15.1 Task Group has reviewed and provided a standard adaptation of the Bluetooth
    specifications (version 1.1) medium access control (MAC) (L2CAP, LMP, and baseband)
    and physical layer (PHY) (radio). Also specified is a clause on service access
    points (SAPs), which includes a logical link control (LLC)-MAC interface for the
    ISO/IEC 8802-2 LLC. A normative annex is included that provides a Protocol Implementation
    Conformance Statement (PICS) proforma, and an informative high-level behavioral
    ITU-T Z.100 specification and description language (SDL) model for an integrated
    Bluetooth MAC sublayer are also specified.'
