abstract:
- content: This standard describes network gateway access, control, and management;
    specifies control and management requirements; defines the system architecture,
    communication sequences, and enhanced functions for the protocols defined in IEEE
    1888(TM), Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network Protocol; and extends the
    protocols and interfaces based on the requirements. This standard shall provide
    enhanced protocols, workflows, and message formats for the network gateway under
    control and management, such as registration, access, control, event handling,
    configuration, status querying, etc.
