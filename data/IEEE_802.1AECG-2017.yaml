abstract:
- content: Ethernet Data Encryption devices (EDEs) are specified in this amendment.
    An EDE is a two-port bridge that uses MACsec to provide secure connectivity for
    attached customer bridges, or for attached provider bridges. EDEs may allow the
    customer (or provider) bridges to continue to use a VLAN Identifier (VID) in transmitted
    frames to select (as already specified in IEEE Std 802.1Q(TM)) between provider
    network or provider backbone network services.
