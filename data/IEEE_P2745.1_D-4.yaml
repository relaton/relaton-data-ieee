abstract:
- content: An approach to preparing a functional specification for a unified power
    flow controller (UPFC) using modular multilevel converter (MMC) is documented
    by this guide. This guide provides the functional requirements for UPFC project
    application, including UPFC system composition, function and performance requirements,
    primary equipment requirements, control and protection requirements, characteristic
    description, spares, engineering studies, testing, documentation, as well as training
    of UPFC projects. The intention of this document is to serve as a base specification
    with an informative annex provided to guide utilities, manufacturers, integrators,
    and other interested entities to apply a particular UPFC project.
