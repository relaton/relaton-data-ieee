abstract:
- content: This amendment defines modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 physical layer
    (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) sublayer that enable determination of absolute
    and relative position with better accuracy with respect to the Fine Timing Measurement
    (FTM) protocol executing on the same PHY-type, while reducing existing wireless
    medium use and power consumption and is scalable to dense deployments. This amendment
    requires backward compatibility and coexistence with legacy devices. Backward
    compatibility with legacy 802.11 devices implies that devices implementing this
    amendment shall (a) maintain data communication compatibility and (b) support
    the Fine Timing Measurement (FTM) protocol.
