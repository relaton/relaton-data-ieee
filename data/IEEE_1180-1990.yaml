abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Feb 07, 2003. No longer endorsed by
    the IEEE. The numerical characteristics of the 8x8 inverse discrete cosine transform
    (IDCT) for use in visual telephony and similar applications where the 8x8 IDCT
    results are used in a reconstruction loop are specified. The specifications ensure
    the compatibility between different implementations of the IDCT.'
