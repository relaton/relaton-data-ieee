abstract:
- content: Criteria that establish protection requirements for Class 1E power systems
    and equipment are prescribed. The purpose of and the means for obtaining protection
    from electrical and mechanical damage or failures that can occur within a time
    period that is shorter than that required for operator action are described. Both
    design and documentation requirements are included.
