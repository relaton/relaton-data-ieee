abstract:
- content: This standard is applicable to ac circuit switchers designed for outdoor
    installation and for rated power frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz and rated maximum
    voltages of 15.5 kV through 245 kV. It is applicable only to three-pole circuit
    switchers for use in three-phase systems. This standard is also applicable to
    the operating devices of circuit switchers and to their auxiliary equipment. Included
    in this document are the normal and special service conditions under which the
    ratings are based and requirements for design and construction, which include
    those for interrupting media, stored energy systems, operating characteristics,
    mechanical loading and operation capabilities, electrical insulation, and auxiliary
    devices. The rating structure establishes the basis for all assigned ratings,
    including continuous current, dielectric withstand voltages, primary-bus fault
    breaking current, transformer-limited fault breaking current, short-circuit making
    current, transient recovery voltages, and capacitor switching, plus associated
    capabilities such as mechanical endurance and operation under high- and low-temperature
    environmental extremes. Routine (production) tests are defined and requirements
    for their execution documented.
