abstract:
- content: This standard describes enhanced security management function forthe protocol
    defined in IEEE 1888 Ubiquitous Green Community ControlNetwork Protocol, specifies
    security requirements, defines system security architecture, gives a standardized
    description of authentication, authorization, along with security procedures and
    protocols. This standard can avoid unintended data disclosure to the public and
    unauthorized access to resources, while providing enhanced integrity and confidentiality
    of transmitted data in the ubiquitous green community control network.
