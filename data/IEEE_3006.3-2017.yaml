abstract:
- content: This recommended practice describes how to determine the impact of preventive
    maintenance on the reliability of industrial and commercial power systems. It
    is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited
    experience in the area of reliability. It can also be an aid to all engineers
    responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.
