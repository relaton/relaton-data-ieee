abstract:
- content: This standard describes the methods and conditions for seismic qualification
    of protective relays and auxiliaries such as test and control switches, terminal
    blocks, and indicating lamps for use in nuclear facilities. The primary intent
    of this standard is to focus on fragility testing and seismic qualification, also
    known as proof testing (either to generic levels or specific levels). This standard
    covers relays used in nuclear facilities, but may also be applied to any area
    in which the seismic response of relays is a design consideration. The prerequisites
    for the seismic test are defined in IEEE Std C37.105TM.
