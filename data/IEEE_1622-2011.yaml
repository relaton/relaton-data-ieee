abstract:
- content: This standard specifies electronic data interchange formats for blank ballot
    distribution, primarily to assist in satisfying the needs of the Uniformed and
    Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) and Military and Overseas Voter
    Empowerment (MOVE) Act. Subsequent standards will address other requirements for
    electronic data interchange formats used by components of voting systems for exchange
    of electronic data. This scope does not include return of cast ballots by electronic
    means. (This PDF of this standard is available as part of the IEEE Get program.
    Through the IEEE SA and industry support, select IEEE standards are available
    for download at no charge. For more details go to our web page at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page.)
