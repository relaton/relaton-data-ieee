abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the air interface, including the medium access
    control layer(MAC)and physical layer (PHY), of combined fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint
    broadband wireless access(BWA) systems providing multiple services. The MAC is
    structured to support multiple physical layer(PHY) specifications, each suited
    to a particular operational environment. The standard enables rapid worldwide
    deployment of innovative, cost effective, and interoperable multivendor broadband
    wireless access products, facilitates competition in broadband access by providing
    alternatives to wireline broadband access, encourages consistent worldwide spectrum
    allocations, and accelerates the commercialization of broadband wireless access
    systems. The standard is a revision of IEEEE Std 02.16-2004, and consolidates
    material from IEEE Std 802.16eTM-2005, IEEE 802.16 004/Cor1-2005, IEEE 802.16fTM-2005,
    and IEEE Std 802.16gTM-2007, along with additional maintenance items and enhancements
    to the management information base specifications. This revision supersedes and
    makes obsolete IEEE Std 802.16-2004 and all of its subsequent amendments and corrigenda.
