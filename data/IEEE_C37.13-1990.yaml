abstract:
- content: This standard covers enclosed low-voltage AC power circuit breakers of
    the stationary or draw-out type of two- or three-pole construction, with one or
    more rated maximum voltages of 635 V (600 V for units incorporating fuses), 508
    V, and 254 V for application on systems having nominal voltages of 600 V, 480
    V, and 240 V; with unfused or fused circuit breakers; manually or power operated;
    and with or without electromechanical or solid-state trip devices. It deals with
    service conditions, ratings, functional components, temperature limitations and
    classifications of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage
    requirements, test procedures, and application.
