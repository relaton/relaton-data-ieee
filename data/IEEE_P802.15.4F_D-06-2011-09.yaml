abstract:
- content: Amendment to IEEE Draft 802.15.4REVi/D07. This amendment provides three
    PHYs that can be used in a wide range of applications requiring various combinations
    of low cost, low energy consumption, multi-year battery life, reliable communications,
    precision location and reader options. This PHY standard supports the performance
    and flexibility needed for future mass deployments of highly populated autonomous
    Active RFID systems anywhere in the world.
