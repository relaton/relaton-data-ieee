abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed December 2010. This guide provides assistance in selecting the
    most appropriate type of surge protector for a particular data, communication,
    and/or signaling circuit application. The purpose of this guide is to enable an
    understanding and an evaluation of the functions of the various types of multiple-component
    data, communications, and signaling circuit protectors in terms of particular
    applications.
