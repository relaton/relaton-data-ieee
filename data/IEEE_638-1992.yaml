abstract:
- content: Procedures for demonstrating the adequacy of new Class 1E transformers,
    located in a mild environment of a nuclear power generating station, to perform
    their required safety functions under postulated service conditions are presented.
    Single- and three-phase transformers rated 601 V to 15,000 V for the highest voltage
    winding and up to 2500 kVA (self-cooled rating) are covered. Because of the conservative
    approach used in the development of this standard for new transformers, the end-point
    criteria cannot be used for in-service transformers.
