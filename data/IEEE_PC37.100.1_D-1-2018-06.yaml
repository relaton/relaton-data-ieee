abstract:
- content: This standard applies to alternating current (ac) switchgear, designed
    for both indoor and outdoor installation and for operation at service frequencies
    up to and including 60 Hz on systems having voltages above 1000 V. This standard
    is applied in relevant equipment standards by a normative reference to this standard,
    IEEE Std C37.100.1, on a section or clause-by-clause basis. Annex A of this standard
    provides recommendations for its application. The inclusion of this standard as
    a normative reference shall not imply that all of the requirements contained herein
    apply as a default. In the absence of a normative reference, this standard shall
    be considered informative only. In case of a conflict in requirements, the requirements
    of the relevant equipment standard shall prevail.
