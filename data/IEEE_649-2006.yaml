abstract:
- content: The basic principles, requirements, and methods for qualifying Class 1E
    motor control centers for both harsh and mild environment applications in nuclear
    power generating stations are described. In addition to defining specific qualification
    requirements for Class 1E motor control centers and their components in accordance
    with the more general qualification requirements of IEEE Std 323-2003, this standard
    is intended to provide guidance in establishing a qualification program for demonstrating
    the adequacy of Class 1E motor control centers in nuclear power generating station
    applications.
