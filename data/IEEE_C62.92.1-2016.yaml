abstract:
- content: The application of neutral grounding to three-phase electrical utility
    systems is described in this guide. It is Part 1 of the IEEE C62.92 series of
    guides for neutral grounding. This guide presents basic considerations of the
    selection of neutral grounding parameters that will provide for the control of
    overvoltage and ground-fault current on all parts of three-phase electrical utility
    systems rated greater than 1000 V.
