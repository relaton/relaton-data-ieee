abstract:
- content: This standard provides recommendations to protect personnel in military
    environments against established adverse health effects associated with exposure
    to electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields, induced and contact current,
    and contact and arcing voltages over the frequency range of 0 Hz to 300 GHz. C95.1-2345
    replaces North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement(STANAG)
    2345 (Edition 3).
