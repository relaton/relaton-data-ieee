abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEC/IEEE 62265-2005. ALF shall serve as the data specification
    language of library elements for design applications used to implement integrated
    circuits. The range of abstraction shall include from the register-transfer level
    (RTL) to the physical level. The language shall model behavior, timing, power,
    signal integrity, physical abstraction and physical implementation rules of library
    elements. The purpose of ALF is to provide a modeling language and semantics for
    functional, physical and electrical performance description of technology-specific
    libraries for cell-based and block-based design. Without a standard, design implementation
    tools would use multiple proprietary and tool-specific library descriptions. The
    semantics would be defined by tool implementations only, which are subject to
    change and prone to mis- interpretation. Also there would be redundancy using
    multiple descriptions for similar library aspects. Therefore a standard is proposed
    to create a consistent library view suitable as a reference for all design implementation
    applications.
