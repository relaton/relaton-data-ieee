abstract:
- content: Supersedes Std. 12207.0 and also makes 12207.2 obsolete. This International
    Standard was jointly developed by ISO/IEC and IEEE. This International Standard
    establishes a common framework for software life cycle processes, with well-defined
    terminology, that can be referenced by the software industry. It applies to the
    acquisition of systems and software products and services, to the supply, development,
    operation, maintenance, and disposal of software products and the software portion
    of a system, whether performed internally or externally to an organization. Those
    aspects of system definition needed to provide the context for software products
    and services are included. Software includes the software portion of firmware.
    This revision integrates ISO/IEC 12207:1995 with its two amendments and was coordinated
    with the parallel revision of ISO/IEC 15288:2002 (System life cycle processes)
    to align structure, terms, and corresponding organizational and project processes.
    This standard may be used stand alone or jointly with ISO/IEC 15288, and supplies
    a process reference model that supports process capability assessment in accordance
    with ISO/IEC 15504-2 (Process assessment). An annex provides support for IEEE
    users and describes relationships of this International Standard to IEEE standards.
