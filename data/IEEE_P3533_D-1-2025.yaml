abstract:
- content: 'The standard specifies the performance evaluation metrics, including definitions,
    descriptions, and classification requirements, evaluation rating criteria, and
    test environment for smart TV system software, along with each testing step. Based
    on product usage scenarios, the performance testing metrics for smart TV system
    software are divided into five main categories: basic performance, video playback
    performance, control performance, screen mirroring performance, as well as performance
    stability and anti-aging performance. The standard defines a tiered evaluation
    system, classifying performance fluency metrics into three 8 levels based on performance
    data, with explanations of the user experience for each level.'
