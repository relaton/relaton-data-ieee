abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice addresses the uses, power sources, design, and
    maintenance of emergency and standby power systems. Chapter 3 is a general discussion
    of needs for and the configuration of emergency and standby systems. Chapter 9
    lists the power needs for specific industries. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the
    selection of power sources. Chapter 6 provides recommendations for protecting
    both power sources and switching equipment during fault conditions. Chapter 7
    provides recommendations for design of system grounding, and Chapter 10 provides
    recommendations for designing to reliability objectives. Chapter 8 provides recommended
    maintenance practices.
