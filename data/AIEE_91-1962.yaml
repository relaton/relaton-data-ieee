abstract:
- content: This Standard represents the progress made to date in evolving graphical
    symbols for use in preparation of logic diagrams for systems of binary-state devices.
    The Standard contains two alternate but overlapping sets of symbols. Since agreement
    on a common set of symbols could not be obtained, no preference is implied between
    the two sets presented herein. This represents a solution that seems best under
    circumstances that presently prevail. It is anticipated that the Standard will
    be reviewed at the Task Group level at regular intervals, and eventually agreement
    will be sought for a set of graphical symbols based on a common symbology. It
    is hoped that groups that have not been represented heretofore will participate
    at Task Group level in the preparation of future revisions.
