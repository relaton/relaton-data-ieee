abstract:
- content: This standard identifies requirements for trusted high assurance analytic
    exchange services over secured and unsecured networks. The standard defines metadata
    and frameworks used to support interactions between nodes that are involved in
    a trusted multipart handshake including discovery of data models and processing
    aspects available at a remote location, appropriate analytic configuration, and
    exchange of vetted critical analytic results. This standard supports the exchange
    of trusted, actionable, and appropriate information for use between analytic producing
    and consuming nodes. The multipart handshake is designed for use between computing
    nodes operating in potentially denied, disrupted intermittent limited bandwidth
    (OOIL) environments. These environments involve critical infrastructure (e.g.,
    medical, transportation and utilities) and might be austere compute environments
    such as those present in IoT and industrial control systems (ICS). The standard
    does not preclude other applications that employ analytic exchanges.
