abstract:
- content: This standard specifies test procedures for compliance and interoperability
    testing of devices implementing the IEEE 1901.3 standard "Standard for Medium
    Frequency (less than 12 MHz) Power Line Communications (PLC) with a Hybrid PLC/Radio
    Frequency Physical Layer (PHY)". This standard also describes application scenarios
    and use cases for IEEE 1901.3 based implementations and associated channel models
    and performance expectations. This standard provides a collection of examples
    of real-life implementations allowing enhancement of test procedures with the
    input from the field.
