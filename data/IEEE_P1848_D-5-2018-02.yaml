abstract:
- content: 'A set of practical methods is provided for helping to manage the levels
    of risks due to electromagnetic (EM) disturbances throughout the lifecycles of
    electronic equipment. These risks include the consequences of all types of errors,
    malfunctions, or failures in products, equipment, and systems that employ modern
    electronic technologies (i.e., in hardware and/or software). The work done in
    creating IEC 61000-1-2:2016 (Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - Part 1-2: General
    - Methodology is supplemented by this standard for the achievement of functional
    safety of electrical and electronic systems including equipment with regard to
    electromagnetic phenomena) by providing requirements for detailed practical techniques
    and measures for helping to manage risks (not just functional safety) that could
    be caused by EM disturbances. These techniques and measures would be used in the
    management, specification, design, implementation, verification and validation,
    and through-life operation, maintenance, repair, refurbishment, upgrading, and
    eventual dismantling for disposal of equipment and systems employing digital electronic
    systems, for both hardware and software (firmware).'
