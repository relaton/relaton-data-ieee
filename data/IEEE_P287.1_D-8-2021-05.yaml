abstract:
- content: The IEEE P287 series of documents presents the combined efforts of IEEE
    P287 Working Group that reflect the knowledge and experience of leading specialists
    in the development and measurement of precision coaxial connectors for RF, microwave
    and millimeter-wave frequencies. It presents minimum performance requirements
    to standardize both hermaphroditic and pin- and socket-type connectors (IEEE P287.1,
    this document). It provides recommended electrical and mechanical test procedures
    for Instrument Grade and Metrology Grade precision connectors (IEEE P287.2). Recommended
    reference procedures including connector effects, connector care and cleaning,
    connector repeatability and reproducibility test procedures, and a color code
    for connectors are detailed in the third part of the standard (IEEE P287.3). A
    bibliography provides a list of pertinent references for measurement techniques
    used in determining electrical, mechanical, and dimensional parameters for coaxial
    connectors.
