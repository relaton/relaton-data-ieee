abstract:
- content: This standard is applicable to three-phase a.c. high-voltage generator
    circuit breakers, hereafter called generator circuit-breaker, designed for indoor
    or outdoor installation and for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz on
    systems having voltages above 1 kV and up to 38 kV. It is applicable to generator
    circuit-breakers that are installed between the generator and the transformer
    terminals. Requirements relative to generator circuit-breakers intended for use
    with generators and transformers rated 10 MVA or more are covered specifically.
    Generator circuits rated less than 10 MVA and pumped storage installations are
    considered special applications, and their requirements are not completely covered
    by this standard. This standard is also applicable to the operating mechanisms
    of generator circuit-breakers and to their auxiliary equipment.
