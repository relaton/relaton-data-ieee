abstract:
- content: The effects of routing, structure type, insulation, shielding, and grounding
    on transmission lines are discussed. The way these transmission-line choices will
    improve or degrade lightning performance is also provided. An additional section
    discusses several special methods that may be used to improve lightning performance.
    Finally, a listing and description of the FLASH program is presented.
