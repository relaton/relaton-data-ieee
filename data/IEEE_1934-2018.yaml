abstract:
- content: OpenFog Consortium--OpenFog Reference Architecture for Fog Computing is
    adopted by this standard. OpenFog Reference Architecture [OPFRA001.020817] is
    a structural and functional prescription of an open, interoperable, horizontal
    system architecture for distributing computing, storage, control and networking
    functions closer to the users along a cloud-to-thing continuum of communicating,
    computing, sensing and actuating entities. It encompasses various approaches to
    disperse Information Technology (IT), Communication Technology (CT) and Operational
    Technology (OT) Services through information messaging infrastructure as well
    as legacy and emerging multi-access networking technologies.
