abstract:
- content: 'A method for real-time exchange of synchronized phasor measurement data
    between power system equipment is defined. This standard specifies messaging that
    can be used with any suitable communication protocol for real-time communication
    between phasor measurement units (PMU), phasor data concentrators (PDC), and other
    applications. It defines message types, contents, and use. Data types and formats
    are specified. A typical measurement system is described. Communication options
    and requirements are described in annexes. Keywords: data concentrator, DC, IEEE
    C37.118.2, PDC, phasor, phasor data concentrator, phasor measurement unit, PMU,
    synchronized phasor, synchrophasor.'
