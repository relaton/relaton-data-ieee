abstract:
- content: A C programming language binding for the Application Program Interface
    (API) to directory services in IEEE Std 1224.2-1993 is defined. This standard
    is intended for use by application developers, system implementors, test method
    writers, and users to support application portability at the source-code level.
    The interface is designed for operational, rather than for management, interactions
    with a directory such as knowledge management or schema management. Security features
    are not generally visible in the interface in order to permit flexibility in security
    policies.
