abstract:
- content: This standard provides general requirements, direction, and methods for
    qualifying Class1E electric cables, field splices, factory splices, and factory
    rework for service in nuclear power generating stations. Categories of cables
    covered are those used for power, control, and instrumentation services, including
    signal and communication cables. Field cables, wires, and splices are within the
    scope of this standard. Cables, wires, and splices within or integral to other
    devices(e.g., instruments, panels, motors, etc.) should be qualified using the
    requirements in the applicable device standard or IEEE Std 323TM-1983, as appropriate.
    However, this standard's requirements may be applied to the wire and cable within
    these devices.
