abstract:
- content: Covered in this guide are basic principles, methods, and experience for
    (design of 110 kV to 1000 kV) alternating current (ac) overhead transmission lines.
    This guide may also be used as a reference for the design of lower-voltage overhead
    transmission lines. Included in this guide are an introduction, definitions, meteorological
    design and criteria, electrical design, structural design criteria, design of
    foundations, experiment results, and design experience. This guide is a listing
    of the information and procedures that can be referenced during the design of
    ac transmission lines. Guidance is provided for transmission line designers in
    the data collection design stage.
