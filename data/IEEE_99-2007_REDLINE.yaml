abstract:
- content: A general form is provided for the preparation of test procedures. Points
    to be considered by technical committees in the preparation of specific instructions
    for the thermal evaluation of insulation systems for electric equipment are suggested.
    The test procedures involve accelerated thermal aging of insulation systems and
    specify tests that the committees deem pertinent, based on conditions of use.
    The objective of the procedures is to provide for the functional evaluation, by
    test, of insulation systems for electric equipment.
