abstract:
- content: Data privacy and information security pose significant challenges to the
    big data and artificial intelligence (AI) community as these communities are increasingly
    under pressure to adhere to regulatory requirements, such as the European Union’s
    General Data Protection Regulation. Many routine operations in big data applications,
    such as merging user data from various sources in order to build a machine learning
    model, are considered to be illegal under current regulatory frameworks. The purpose
    of federated machine learning is to provide a feasible solution that enables machine
    learning applications to utilize the data in a distributed manner that does not
    exchange raw data directly and does not allow any party to infer private information
    of other parties. This white paper intends to present an overview of the Federated
    Machine Learning (FML) technology that can be used as a basis for standards, certifications,
    laws, policies, and/or product ratings. This white paper targets an educated audience,
    including lawmakers, corporate and governmental policy makers, manufacturers,
    engineers, and standard setting bodies. However, this white paper is also easily
    understood by non?technical managers and policy makers as it provides system developers
    and manufacturers with an overview of Federated Machine Learning techniques. Finally,
    one must give credit to the IEEE Federated Machine Learning (P3652.1) working
    group participants for their tremendous dedication, expertise and thoughtful collaborations,
    without which the publication of IEEE Std 3652.1?2020 [1] would not have been
    possible .
