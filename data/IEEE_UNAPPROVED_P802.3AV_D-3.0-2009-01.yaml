abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2008 provides physical layer specifications
    and management parameters for 10G-EPON on point-to-multipoint passive optical
    networks. 10G-EPON uses the network architecture of IEEE Std 802.3¿s 1G-EPON,
    providing support for both symmetric and asymmetric data rates while maintaining
    complete backward compatibility with already deployed equipment.
