abstract:
- content: Information for selecting the proper circuit breaker for a particular application
    is provided. Application engineers are aided in specifying the type of circuit
    breaker, ratings, trip functions, and accessories. Circuit breakers for special
    applications, e.g., instantaneous only and switches are discussed. In addition,
    information for applying circuit breakers at different locations in the power
    system and for protecting specific components is provided.
