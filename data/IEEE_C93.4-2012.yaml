abstract:
- content: 'Power-line carrier (PLC) line-tuning equipment connected between the coupling
    capacitors and PLC transmitter/receiver terminals operating in the frequency range
    of 30 kHz to 500 kHz over power transmission lines and cables or to similar line-tuning
    equipment in a carrier bypass are addressed in this standard. PLC line-tuning
    equipment includes assemblies and components: tuning inductor, impedance matching
    transformer, balancing transformer, tuning capacitor, inductance-capacitance (LC)
    tuning unit, hybrid, filter, protective unit, interconnecting cables, and enclosure.
    This standard includes the protective devices that facilitate the safe operation
    and maintenance of the line-tuning components under normal and usual operating
    conditions. This standard will develop technical definitions, performance ratings,
    testing methods, and manufacturing requirements for the included line-tuning equipment.'
