abstract:
- content: '" The media access control characteristics for the Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access with Collision De-tection (CSMA/CD) access method for shared medium local
    area networks are described. The control charac-teristics for full duplex dedicated
    channel use are also described. Specifications are provided for MAU types1BASE5
    at 1 Mb/s; Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) and MAU types 10BASE5, 10BASE2, FOIRL
    (fiber opticinter-repeater link), 10BROAD36, 10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL, 10BASE-FB, and
    10BASE-FP at 10 Mb/s; MediaIndependent Interface (MII) and PHY types 100BASE-T4,
    100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX, and 100BASE-T2 at100 Mb/s; and the Gigabit MII (GMII)
    and 1000BASE-X PHY types, 1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, and1000BASE-CX, which operate
    at 1000 Mb/s (Gigabit Ethernet) as well as PHY type 1000BASE-T. Repeaterspecifications
    are provided at each speed. Full duplex specifications are provided at the Physical
    Layer for10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL, 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX, 100BASE-T2, and Gigabit
    Ethernet. System consider-ations for multisegment networks at each speed and management
    information base (MIB) specifications andadditions to support Virtual Bridged
    Local Area Networks (VLANs) as specified in IEEE P802.1Q (R) are also pro-vided.
    Also specified is an optional Link Aggregation sublayer which multiple physical
    links to be aggregatedtogethere to form a single logical link. "'
