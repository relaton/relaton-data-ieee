abstract:
- content: This guide provides information on the selection and application considerations
    for the unit power transformer and unit auxiliaries power transformer. Consideration
    is given to connections that include direct connection and connections through
    generator circuit breakers and load-break switches. The considerations referred
    to in this guide apply to hydroelectric and thermal electric generating stations.
    Various power transformer connections and possible operating problems under normal
    and abnormal conditions are treated. Phasing procedures, basic impulse insulation
    level selection, and loading practices are not covered.
