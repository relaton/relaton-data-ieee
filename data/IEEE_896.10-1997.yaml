abstract:
- content: 'In the Futurebus+&#174; series of standards, tools with which high-performance
    bus-based systems may be developed are provided. This architecture provides a
    wide range of performance scalability over both cost and time for multiple generations
    of single- and multiple-bus multiprocessor systems. This document, a companion
    standard to the ISO/IEC 10857: 1994 (ANSI/IEEE Std 896.1, 1994 Edition) Futurebus+(R)
    Logical Layer Specification, builds on the logical layer by adding requirements
    for a spaceborne profile. It is to this profile that products will claim conformance.
    Other specifications may be required in conjunction with this standard.'
