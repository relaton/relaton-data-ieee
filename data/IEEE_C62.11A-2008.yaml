abstract:
- content: Metal-oxide surge arresters designed to repeatedly limit the voltage surges
    on 48 Hz to 62 Hz power circuits (&gt;1000 V) by passing surge discharge current
    and automatically limiting the flow of system power current applies to this amendment.
    This amendment covers devices for separate mounting and to those supplied integrally
    with other equipment. The tests demonstrate that an arrester can survive the rigors
    of reasonable environmental conditions and system phenomena, while, at the same
    time, protect equipment and/or the system from damaging overvoltages caused by
    lightning, switching, or other undesirable surges.
