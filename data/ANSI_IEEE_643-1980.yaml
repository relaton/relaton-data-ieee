abstract:
- content: The purpose of this guide is to provide application information to users
    of carrier equipment as applied on power transmission lines. It is hoped that
    this guide will be useful to the initial user of power line carriers as well as
    to the experienced application engineer. Detailed references have been provided
    in the guide for those who require more information. Material on power line carrier
    channel characteristics is presented along with discussions on intrabundle conductor
    systems and insulated shield wire systems. Procedures for the calculation of channel
    performance are given. Major coupling components considered are line traps, coupling
    capacitors, line tuners, coaxial cables, hybrids, and filters. Frequency selection
    practices and future trends are also discussed
