abstract:
- content: 'The MATH_REAL package declaration, the MATH_COMPLEX package declaration,
    and the semantics of the standard mathematical definition and conventional meaning
    of the functions that are part of this standard are provided. Ways for users to
    implement this standard are given in an informative annex. Samples of the MATH_REAL
    and MATH_COMPLEX package bodies are provided in an informative annex on diskette
    as guidelines for implementors to verify their implementation of this standard.
    Implementors may choose to implement the package bodies in the most efficient
    manner available to them. The standard package bodies (subclauses B.1 and B.2)
    are available for free download at: http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/1076/1076.2-1996/'
