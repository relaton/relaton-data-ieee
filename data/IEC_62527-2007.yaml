abstract:
- content: 'This standard extends IEEE Std 1450-1999 (STIL) to support the definition
    of DC levels. STIL language constructs are defined to specify the DC conditions
    necessary to execute digital vectors on automated test equipment (ATE). STIL language
    extensions include structures for: (a) specifying the DC conditions for a device
    under test; (b) specifying DC conditions either globally, by pattern burst, by
    pattern, or by vector; (c) specifying alternate DC levels; and (d) selecting DC
    levels and alternate levels within a period, much the same as timed format events.'
