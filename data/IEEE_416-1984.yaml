abstract:
- content: This standard defines ATLAS, the Abbreviated Test Language for All Systems,
    which offers a standardized test language for expressing test specifications and
    test procedures. It is a test-oriented language independent of test equipment,
    and provides a standard abbreviated English language used in the preparation and
    documentation of test procedures that can be implemented either manually or with
    automatic and semi-automatic equipment. ATLAS was originally developed for avionics
    applications under the auspices of Aeronautical Radio, Inc (ARINC). As the language
    expanded into non-avionic applications, the original sponsors recommended the
    transfer of further ATLAS development to the IEEE.
