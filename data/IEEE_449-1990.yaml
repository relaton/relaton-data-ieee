abstract:
- content: Requirements are provided for ferroresonant voltage regulators that operate
    at relatively constant frequencies and provide substantially constant output voltages
    in spite of relatively large changes of input voltage. Requirements for controlled
    ferroresonant regulators that maintain substantially constant output voltages
    regardless of variations, within limits, of input voltage, temperature, frequency,
    and output load are also included. The requirements cover definitions, symbols,
    and circuit schematics; service conditions; ratings; nameplate and otherre markings;
    testing; application; and maintenance. Provision is made for relating the characteristics
    of ferroresonant regulators to associated rectifiers and circuits.
