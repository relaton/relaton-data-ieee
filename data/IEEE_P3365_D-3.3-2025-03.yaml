abstract:
- content: As the sales of EV continue to increase and the 1 ir service life extends,
    the lithium-ion batteries, the core components of EV, face challenges in terms
    of performance degradation and safety. Therefore, regular inspection of battery
    state is crucial. Traditional battery testing methods involve dismantling the
    battery pack, which is time-consuming, costly, and requires harsh testing conditions.
    Furthermore, since EV users are unable to obtain battery data and monitor its
    health status during daily use, this leads to concerns about vehicle safety and
    range anxiety. This guide specifies a performance index that includes the information
    that EV users are concerned about, simplified testing procedures and provides
    objective, third-party evaluation results. It helps users to evaluate the performance
    of on-board batteries and discover the batteries’ potential safety risks as well.
