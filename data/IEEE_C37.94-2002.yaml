abstract:
- content: 'This IEEE Standard is part of the C37 Family on Switchgear, Substations
    &amp; Protective Relays. Project scope: This standard describes the interconnection
    details for N times 64 kilobit per second connections of teleprotection equipment
    to digital multiplexers using optical fiber. Requirements for both physical connection
    and the communications timing are also included. Project purpose: The purpose
    of this standard is to define an interconnection of different vendors'' relays
    with different vendors'' multiplex equipment, without any restriction on the ocntent
    of the N times 64 kilobit per second data, using up to 2 kilometer of 50 micrometer
    or 62.5 micrometer multimode fiber.'
