abstract:
- content: In today's digital age, technology has a firm grasp on practically every
    aspect of human life, consequently there is growing cross-sector demand to help
    individuals build digital competencies such as digital literacy, digital skills,
    and digital readiness. However, there is no universally accepted meaning of terms
    like &#x201C;digital literacy,&#x201D; &#x201C;digital skills,&#x201D; or &#x201C;digital
    readiness,&#x201D; which can lead to difficulty coordinating efforts to improve
    digital competencies worldwide. Digital Intelligence (DQ) was developed to encompass
    a comprehensive set of technical, cognitive, meta-cognitive, and socio-emotional
    competencies, which are grounded in universal moral values and enable individuals
    to face the challenges of digital life and adapt to its demands. The DQ Framework
    is comprised of 8 areas of digital life--identity, use, safety, security, emotional
    intelligence, literacy, communication, and rights--across 3 levels of experience--citizenship,
    creativity, and competitiveness. The objective of this standard is to establish
    a DQ global standard that encompasses a common framework to ensure that digital
    competency building efforts are coordinated globally. It includes a common set
    of definitions, language, and understanding of digital literacy, skills, and readiness
    that can be adopted by all stakeholders worldwide, including national governments,
    the educational industry, the technology industry, international agencies, private
    companies, and society as a whole.
