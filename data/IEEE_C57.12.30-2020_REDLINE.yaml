abstract:
- content: 'Conformance tests and requirements for the coating integrity of pole-mounted
    enclosures containing apparatus energized in excess of 600 V, and for application
    in coastal environments, are specified in this standard. These enclosures are
    typically located out of reach of the general public, and include, but are not
    limited to, the following types of equipment enclosures: pole-mounted distribution
    transformers, pole-mounted switches, pole-mounted regulators, pole-mounted metering
    equipment, pole-mounted reclosers, and pole-mounted switchgear.'
