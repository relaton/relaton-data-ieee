abstract:
- content: This standard defines a set of tools for efficient compression of geometry
    point clouds and the corresponding definitions of syntax, semantics, parsing and
    decoding processes, including but not limited to prediction, transform, quantization,
    and entropy coding, etc. This standard provides efficient coding tool sets for
    compression, decompression, processing and packaging of point cloud data, which
    can significantly reduce the disk storage and communication bandwidth. The target
    applications and services include but are not limited to manufacturing, mapping,
    ecommerce, e-tourism, digital culture heritage.
