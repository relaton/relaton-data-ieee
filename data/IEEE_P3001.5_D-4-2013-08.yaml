abstract:
- content: This recommended practice covers the selection and application of power
    distribution apparatus used in industrial and commercial power systems. It is
    likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience
    with this equipment. It can also be an aid to all engineers responsible for the
    electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.
