abstract:
- content: An evaluation method to assess the robustness of invisible watermarking
    implementations in unstructured digital content, including images, video, audio,
    documents, and webpages, is described in this standard. Also described are distortion
    inferences that may result in the compromise of the watermark information embedded
    in digital content. Furthermore, the metrics used for evaluation and test cases
    for assessing the robustness against different distortion inferences are specified.
    This standard does not specify the evaluation for the robustness of the watermarking
    implementations in structured content, for example, a database. The risks faced
    with watermarking implementations in structured content are different from those
    of unstructured content and need different test cases.
