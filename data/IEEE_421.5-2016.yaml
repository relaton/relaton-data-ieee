abstract:
- content: Excitation system and power system stabilizer models suitable for use in
    large-scale system stability studies are presented. Important excitation limiters
    and supplementary controls are also included. The model structures presented are
    intended to facilitate the use of field test data as a means of obtaining model
    parameters. The models are, however, reduced order models and do not necessarily
    represent all of the control loops of any particular system. The models are valid
    for frequency deviations of 5% from rated frequency and oscillation frequencies
    up to 3 Hz. These models would not normally be adequate for use in studies of
    subsynchronous resonance or other shaft torsional interaction behavior. Delayed
    protective and control features that may come into play in long-term dynamic performance
    studies are not represented. A sample set of data for each of the models, for
    at least one particular application, is provided.
