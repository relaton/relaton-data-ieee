abstract:
- content: A comprehensive guide to practical line current differential schemes using
    digital communications. Operating principles, synchronization methods, communication
    channel requirements, technologies, and design, current transformer requirements,
    external time reference requirements, backup considerations, testing considerations,
    and troubleshooting are included. This guide also provides specific guidelines
    for various application aspects including multi-terminal lines, series compensated
    lines, mutually coupled lines, line charging current, in-zone transformers and
    reactors, single-phase tripping and reclosing.
