abstract:
- content: A high-speed serial bus that interates well with most IEEE standard 32-bit
    and 64-bit parallel buses, as well as such nonbus interconnects as the IEEE Std
    1596-1992, Scalable Coherent Interface, is specified. It is intended to provide
    a low-cost interconnect between cards on the same backplane, cards on other backplanes,
    and external peripherals. This standard follows the IEEE Std 1212-1991 Command
    and Status Register (CSR) architecture.
