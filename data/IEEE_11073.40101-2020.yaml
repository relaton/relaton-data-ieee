abstract:
- content: For Personal Health Devices (PHDs) and Point-of-Care Devices (PoCDs), an
    iterative, systematic, scalable, and auditable approach to identification of cybersecurity
    vulnerabilities and estimation of risk is defined by this standard. The standard
    presents one approach to iterative vulnerability assessment that uses the Spoofing,
    Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation
    of Privilege (STRIDE) classification scheme and the embedded Common Vulnerability
    Scoring System (eCVSS). The assessment includes system context, system decomposition,
    pre-mitigation scoring, mitigation, and post-mitigation scoring and iterates until
    the remaining vulnerabilities are reduced to an acceptable level of risk.
