abstract:
- content: Over the years, the isolated-phase bus has received widespread application
    in connecting the output of generators to step-up transformers. The trend toward
    generating units of larger capacity has dictated the need for higher rated isolated-phase
    bus designs. The increased losses associated with the higher capacity bus may
    be significant in the economic evaluation of alternate schemes or selection of
    equipment. The bus designer must know the magnitude and distribution of losses
    in order to keep temperature rises of bus components within the limits specified
    in USA Standard C37.20. In addition, the losses must be known to permit proper
    sizing of forced-cooling equipment whenever it is used.Various papers have been
    presented that deal with the determination of losses in isolated-phase bus enclosures.
    The difference in the results obtained for the same bus using various methods
    is of sufficient magnitude to cause concern. The industry has indicated the need
    for a guide for calculating losses to establish a common yardstick for establishing,
    evaluating, and applying different designs.
