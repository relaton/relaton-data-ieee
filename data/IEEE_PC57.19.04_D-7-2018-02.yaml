abstract:
- content: The electrical, dimensional, and related special requirements for high
    current rating power transformer bushings within bus enclosures that have rated
    continuous current in excess of 5000 A are addressed in this standard. Bushings
    covered by this standard are intended for use as components of liquid-filled transformers,
    including but not limited to Generator Step-Up (GSU) Transformers.
