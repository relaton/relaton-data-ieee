abstract:
- content: 'Conformance checks for eXtensible Markup Language (XML) data designed
    to describeelectronic systems are formulated by this standard. The meta-data forms
    that are standardizedinclude: components, systems, bus interfaces and connections,
    abstractions of those buses, anddetails of the components including address maps,
    register and field descriptions, and file setdescriptions for use in automating
    design, verification, documentation, and use flows for electronicsystems. A set
    of XML schemas of the form described by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)and
    a set of semantic consistency rules (SCRs) are included. A generator interface
    that is portableacross tool environments is provided. The specified combination
    of methodology-independentmeta-data and the tool-independent mechanism for accessing
    that data provides for portability ofdesign data, design methodologies, and environment
    implementations.'
