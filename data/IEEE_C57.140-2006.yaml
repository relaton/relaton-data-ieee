abstract:
- content: 'This guide includes guidelines for the following: insulating oil maintenance
    and diagnostics, oil reclamation, testing methods for the determination of remaining
    insulation (paper) life, and upgrades of auxiliary equipment such as bushings,
    gauges, deenergized tap changers (DETCs), load tap changers (LTCs) (where applicable),
    and coil reclamping. The goal of this guide is to assist the user in extending
    the useful life of a transformer.'
