abstract:
- content: This standard builds upon IEEE Std 1547 for the interconnection of distributed
    resources (DR) to distribution secondary network systems. This standard establishes
    recommended criteria, requirements and tests, and provides guidance for interconnection
    of distribution secondary network system types of area electric power systems
    (area EPS) with distributed resources (DR) providing electric power generation
    in local electric power systems (Local EPS).
