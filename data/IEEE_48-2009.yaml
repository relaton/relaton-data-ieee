abstract:
- content: This standard covers all indoor and outdoor cable terminations used on
    alternating-current shielded cables having laminated insulation from 2.5 kV through
    765 kV and extruded insulation rated 2.5 kV through 500 kV, except separable insulated
    connectors, which are covered by IEEE Std 386. Cable terminations and component
    parts shall be capable of withstanding the tests specified in this standard.
