abstract:
- content: Guidance and recommendations for conducting selected processes, activities,
    and tasks for systems and software products requiring assurance claims for properties
    selected for special attention (called critical properties) are given in this
    adoption of ISO/IEC 15026-4:2012. IEEE Std 15026-4&#x2122;-2013 specifies a property-independent
    list of processes, activities and tasks to achieve the claim and show the achievement
    of the claim. IEEE Std 15026-4-2013 establishes the processes, activities, tasks,
    guidance, and recommendations in the context of a defined life cycle model and
    set of life cycle processes for system and/or software life cycle management.
