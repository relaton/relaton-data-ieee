abstract:
- content: Federated machine learning defines a machine learning framework that allows
    a collective model to be constructed from data that is distributed across repositories
    owned by different organizations or devices. A blueprint for data usage and model
    building across organizations and devices while meeting applicable privacy, security
    and regulatory requirements is provided in this guide. It defines the architectural
    framework and application guidelines for federated machine learning, including
    description and definition of federated machine learning; the categories federated
    machine learning and the application scenarios to which each category applies;
    performance evaluation of federated machine learning; and associated regulatory
    requirements.
