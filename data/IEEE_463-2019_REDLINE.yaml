abstract:
- content: Means for improved safeguarding of personnel while operating or maintaining
    equipment located in electrolytic cell line working zones are provided in this
    standard. Related requirements for equipment and electrical conductor installations
    are also included. The general types of electrolytic cells covered include, but
    are not limited to, the direct current cells used in the production of aluminum,
    cadmium, sodium chlorate, chlorine, copper, fluorine, hydrogen peroxide, magnesium,
    sodium, and zinc.
