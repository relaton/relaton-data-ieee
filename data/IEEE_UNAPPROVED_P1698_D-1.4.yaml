abstract:
- content: The design of automatic train protection and signal systems for fixed guideway
    (e.g. rail) transit systems requires knowledge of the braking distance of the
    vehicles utilized on the systems. This guide provides methods and assumptions
    used in calculating the braking distances of rail transit vehicles. The methods
    encompass automatic train protection and signal system operation, propulsion and
    brake system operation, environmental conditions, operator interfaces, tolerances,
    and failure modes.
