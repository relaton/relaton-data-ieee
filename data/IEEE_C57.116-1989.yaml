abstract:
- content: The selection, application, and specification considerations for the unit
    transformer and unit auxiliaries transformers are described, taking into account
    their connections, voltage and kilovoltampere ratings, and excitation and through-fault
    capabilities during possible operating conditions, both normal and abnormal. Consideration
    is given to direct connections and connections through generator breakers and
    load-break switches. Both hydroelectric and thermal electric generating stations
    are covered. Phasing procedures, basic impulse insulation-level selection, and
    loading practices are not covered.
