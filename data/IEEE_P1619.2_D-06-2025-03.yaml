abstract:
- content: EME2-AES wide-block encryption with associated data (EAD) mode of the NIST
    AES block cipher, providing usage guidelines and test vectors, is described. A
    wide-block encryption algorithm behaves as a single block cipher with a large
    plaintext input and ciphertext output, but uses a narrow block cipher (in this
    case Advanced Encryption Standard [AES]) internally. This encryption mode is oriented
    toward random access storage devices that do not provide authentication, but need
    to reduce the granularity of a potential attack.
