- content: Requirements for power line carrier (PLC) transmitter/receiver equipment
    used to transfer discrete teleprotection signals at power line carrier frequencies
    (30-500 kHz) are described in this standard. Test requirements and conditions
    for determining performance, as well as manufacturing requirements, are defined.
