abstract:
- content: The basic dimensions of a range of modular subracks conforming to IEC 60297-3
    (1984-01) and IEC 60297-4 (1995-03) for mounting in equipment according to IEC
    60297-1 (1986-09) and ANSI/EIA 310-D-1992, together with the basic dimensions
    of a compatible range of plug-in units, printed boards, and backplanes, are covered.
    The dimensions and tolerances necessary to ensure mechanical function compatibility
    are provided. This standard offers total system integration guidelines with attendant
    advantages, such as reduction in design and development time, manufacturing cost
    savings, and distinct marketing advantages.
