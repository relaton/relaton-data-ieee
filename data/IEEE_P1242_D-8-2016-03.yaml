abstract:
- content: Information on the specification and selection of power, control, and special-purpose
    cable, as typically used in petroleum, chemical, and similar plants, is provided
    in this guide. Materials, design, testing, and applications are addressed. More
    recent developments, such as strand filling, low smoke, zero-halogen materials,
    chemical-moisture barriers, and fire-resistive cables have been included.
