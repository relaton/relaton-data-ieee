abstract:
- content: The impact of artificial intelligence or autonomous and intelligent systems
    (A/IS) on humans is measured by this standard. The positive outcome of A/IS on
    human well-being is the overall intent of this standard. Scientifically valid
    well-being indices currently in use and based on a stakeholder engagement process
    ground this standard. Product development guidance, identification of areas for
    improvement, risk management, performance assessment, and the identification of
    intended and unintended users, uses and impacts on human well-being of A/IS are
    the intents of this standard.
