abstract:
- content: Amendment to IEEE Standard P802.15.4-2011. This amendment provides two
    PHYs (MSK and LRP UWB) that can be used in a wide range of applications requiring
    various combinations of low cost, low energy consumption, multi-year battery life,
    reliable communications, precision location and reader options. This PHY standard
    supports the performance and flexibility needed for future mass deployments of
    highly populated autonomous Active RFID Systems anywhere in the world.
