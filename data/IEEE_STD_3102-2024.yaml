abstract:
- content: Challenges in conducting measurement and verification in conservation voltage
    reduction (CVR) deployed feeders are faced by utilities. A standard is needed
    to provide procedures for electric utilities to determine the energy savings and
    CVR factors of their CVR programs, to define parameters for regulatory reporting,
    and to define standardized verification methodology selection based on standard
    data collection methodologies. The specification of CVR data management and collection
    procedures for use by the electric utility industry to enable energy savings is
    the purpose of this standard. Electric utilities, electric utility equipment manufacturers,
    software vendors, and electric utility regulatory commissions are the included
    stakeholders for this standard.
