abstract:
- content: 'The proliferation of connected users and downloaded applications has driven
    the development of a new paradigm in wireless mobile networks. Additional air
    interfaces operating in the unlicensed spectrum serving as supplementary downlinks
    (SDL) and enhancing end-user throughput are utilized by this paradigm. However,
    integrating these interfaces into licensed base stations can be challenging, as
    they are distributed across various domains. WiFi is a key technology for increasing
    capacity through the user plane interface. Traffic is buffered in WiFi when unlicensed
    channels become unavailable, and transmissions resume once new radio slots are
    free. To meet the strict round-time delay requirements of fifth generation (5G)
    networks, a new virtual controller that resides at the mobile edge cloud is defined
    in this standard. The multi-connectivity model and traffic sharing between licensed
    and unlicensed interfaces are coordinated by the controller based on the real-time
    availability of unlicensed channels for specific user equipment.Two schemes are
    presented for managing multi-connectivity modes: distributed and centralized.
    In the distributed scheme, traffic forwarding and steering between distributed
    radio interfaces across domain sites is managed by the controller. In the centralized
    scheme, various radio interfaces are co‑located in the same base station, and
    traffic steering is managed by the controller through a new unified 5G media access
    control (MAC) design. Traffic sharing between different interfaces is ensured
    by the controller, given that access to operator-deployed WiFis or any other customer
    WiFi using separate service level agreements (SLAs) is provided by operators.
    Multi-connectivity modes imply the provision of efficient new services that may
    require measuring airtime for each interface and changes to user plane topology.'
