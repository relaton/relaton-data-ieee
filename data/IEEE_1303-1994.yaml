abstract:
- content: General guidelines and criteria for the field testing of static var compensators
    (SVCs) before they are placed in-service, for the purpose of verifying their specified
    performance are described. The major elements of a commissioning program are identified
    so that the user can formulate a specific plan that is most suited for his or
    her own SVC.
