abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the architecture, abstraction layers, interfaces
    and metadata requirements for Spectrum Characterization and Occupancy Sensing
    (SCOS) system, and defines performance parameters, units and measures. This SCOS
    system comprises one or more semi-autonomous Spectrum Sensing Devices which scan
    electromagnetic spectrum, digitize it and perform processing, transmitting the
    resultant data with appropriate metadata to a central storage and processing system,
    according to rules, policies or instructions imposed on the Spectrum Sensing Devices
    by a management system.
