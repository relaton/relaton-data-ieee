abstract:
- content: This document contains two standards. ANSI N42.5 specifies bases for Geiger-Mueller
    counter tubes. ANSI N42.6 specifies interrelating mechanical and electrical properties
    so that quartz-fiber exposure meters may be used with any charger. Characteristics
    peculiar to these devices but not affecting the interrelationship between chargers
    and exposure meters are omitted.
