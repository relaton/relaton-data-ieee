abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance for the application of test methods to
    evaluate cable systems installed in nuclear facilities. This recommended practice
    covers low voltage (2000 V or less) and medium voltage (2001 V to 46 000 V) cable
    systems, both shielded and non-shielded cable types.
