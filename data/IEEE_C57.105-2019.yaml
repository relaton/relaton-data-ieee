abstract:
- content: This guide describes transformer connections and configurations in three-phase
    electrical systems. The characteristics of the various transformer connections
    and possible operating problems under normal or abnormal conditions are treated.
    All combinations of delta and wye, grounded and ungrounded, T-connected, zigzag,
    and certain special connections are considered. Only two-winding and auto-transformers
    are included.
