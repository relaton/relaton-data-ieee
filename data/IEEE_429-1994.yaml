abstract:
- content: A test procedure for comparing two or more sealed insulation systems in
    accordance with their expected life at rated temperature is outlined. The procedure
    is limited to insulation systems for alternating-current (ac) electrical machines
    using form-wound preinsulated stator coils rated 6900 V and below.
