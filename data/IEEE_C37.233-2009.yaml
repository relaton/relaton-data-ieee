abstract:
- content: Test approaches and procedures for the components and the overall protection
    and control system functions are presented. Test of equipment in the system protection
    scheme, associated communications equipment, auxiliary power supplies, and the
    control of power apparatus are addressed. Much of the testing emphasizes a bottom-up
    approach, in which the basic behavior of scheme components are verified first,
    followed by testing of interconnected components in a function-oriented assembly.
