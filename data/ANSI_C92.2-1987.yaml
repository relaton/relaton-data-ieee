abstract:
- content: This standard supersedes ANSI C92.2-1981, Preferred Voltage Ratings for
    Alternating-Current Electrical Systems and Equipment Operating at Voltages Above
    230 kV Nominal. Preferred maximum voltage ratings provide guidance in the development
    and design of these systems and equipment. Preferred nominal voltage ratings are
    included to provide consistent standard designations for electrical systems in
    the extra-high and ultra-high voltage classes. This standard includes preferred
    voltage ratings up to and including 1200 kV maximum system voltage, as defined
    in the standard. Above this value, additional research and development work is
    needed before standard voltage levels can be specified. It is expected that the
    next voltage level to be established will be as high as is technically and economically
    feasible at the time that it is introduced.
