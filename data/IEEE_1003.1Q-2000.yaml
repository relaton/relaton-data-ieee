abstract:
- content: This amendment is part of the POSIX series of standards for applications
    and user interfaces to open systems. The purpose of this project is to specify
    a set of interfaces to allow portable access to underlying trace management services
    by application programs. These underlying services provide access to streams of
    event data, where the events can be generated by software and/or hardware, either
    from the application or the operating system. This standard is stated in terms
    of its C language binding.
