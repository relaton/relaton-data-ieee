abstract:
- content: A uniform method for calculating and measuring torque pulsations that occur
    during starting of synchronous motors is provided. Synchronous motors, as discussed
    in this guide, applies to all types of excited synchronous motors, including laminated
    or solid, salient or nonsalient machines, as well as nonexcited synchronous-reluctance
    motors.
