abstract:
- content: The inverse-time characteristics of overcurrent relays are defined in this
    standard. Operating equations and allowances are provided in the standard. The
    standard defines an integral equation for microprocessor relays that ensures coordination
    not only in the case of constant current input but for any current condition of
    varying magnitude. Electromechanical inverse-time overcurrent relay reset characteristics
    are defined in the event that designers of microprocessor based relays and computer
    relays want to match the reset characteristics of the electromechanical relays.
