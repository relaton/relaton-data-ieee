abstract:
- content: 'This document specifies the standard approach for mapping between IEEE
    Std 1815 (Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3)) and IEC 61850 (Communications Networks
    and Systems for Power Utility Automation). Two primary use cases are addressed;
    A) Mapping between an IEEE Std 1815 based master and an IEC 61850 based remote
    site and B) Mapping between an IEC 61850 based master and an IEEE Std 1815 based
    remote site. Mapping aspects included in the standard are: conceptual architecture;
    general mapping requirements; the mapping of Common Data Classes, Constructed
    Attribute Classes and Abstract Communication Service Interface (ASCI); cyber security
    requirements, the architecture of a gateway used for translation and requirements
    for embedding mapping configuration information into IEC 61850 System Configuration
    Language (SCL) and DNP3 Device Profile. This specification addresses a selection
    of features, data classes and services of the two standards.'
