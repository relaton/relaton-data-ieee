abstract:
- content: Superseded This document presents a number of tests for use in determining
    the significant parameters and performance characteristics of electronic transformers
    and inductors. These tests are primarily desinged for transformers and inductors
    used in all types of electronic applications, but they are also applicable to
    many other types of transformers, except transformers of large apparant-power
    rating used in the electric power industry. Many of the tests described are applicable
    as means of specifying the required testing of transformers for specific applications.
