abstract:
- content: This document establishes a common process framework for describing the
    full life cycle of software systems from conception through retirement. It applies
    to the acquisition or development of software products and services whether performed
    internally or externally to an organization. Those aspects of software system
    definition needed to provide the context for software products and services are
    included. The document also supports the definition, control, assessment, and
    improvement of these processes.
