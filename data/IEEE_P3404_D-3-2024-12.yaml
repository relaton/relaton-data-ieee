abstract:
- content: In many AI scenarios, data and model sharing is essential for supporting
    communication, interaction, and collaboration among multiple computing centers.
    This standard specifies the framework and functional requirements for sharing
    data and models across multiple computing centers. Three use cases are provided
    for analyzing the standardization requirements and considerations.
