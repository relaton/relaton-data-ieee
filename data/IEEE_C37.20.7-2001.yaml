abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std C37.20.7-2007. A procedure for testing and evaluating
    the performance of metal-enclosed switchgear for internal arcing faults is covered.
    A method of identifying the capabilities of this equipment is given. Service conditions,
    installation, and application of equipment are also discussed.
