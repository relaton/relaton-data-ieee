abstract:
- content: Techniques for objective measurement of electroacoustic and voice switching
    characteristics of analog and digital handsfree telephones (HFTs) are provided.
    Due to the various characteristics of HFTs and the environments in which they
    operate, not all of the test procedures in this standard are applicable to all
    HFTs. Application of the test procedures to atypical HFTs should be determined
    on an individual basis.
