abstract:
- content: Information and general recommendations of instrumentation, circuitry,
    calibration, and measurement techniques of no-load losses (excluding auxiliary
    losses), excitation current, and load losses of power and distribution transformers
    are provided. The guide is intended as a complement to the test code procedures
    given in Clause 8 and Clause 9 of IEEE Std C57.12.90&#8482;.
