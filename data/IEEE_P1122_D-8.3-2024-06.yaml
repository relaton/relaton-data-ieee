abstract:
- content: The terms specifically related to the digital recorders used for making
    high-voltage and high-current impulse measurements are defined in this standard,
    which also specifies the necessary performance characteristics for such digital
    recorders to demonstrate their compliance with the requirements for high-voltage
    and high-current impulse tests, and describes the tests and procedures that are
    necessary to show that these performance characteristics are within the specified
    limits
