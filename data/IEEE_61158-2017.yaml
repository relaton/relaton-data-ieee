abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 61158(TM) is an adoption of the EPSG DS 301, Ethernet POWERLINK--Communication
    Profile Specification. Ethernet POWERLINK is a communication profile for Real-Time
    Ethernet (RTE). It extends Ethernet according to IEEE Std 802.3(TM) with mechanisms
    to transfer data with predictable timing and precise synchronisation. The communication
    profile meets timing demands typical for high-performance automation and motion
    applications. It does not change basic principles of the Fast Ethernet Standard
    IEEE Std 802.3 but extends it towards RTE. Thus it is possible to leverage and
    continue to use any standard Ethernet silicon, infrastructure component, or test
    and measurement equipment like a network analyzer.
