abstract:
- content: The engineering and design of flexible bus connections for bus and equipment
    in electric power substations is described. This recommended practice gives guidance
    to the substation engineer who is unfamiliar with seismic considerations in the
    engineering and design of connections, and provides engineers with the current
    state of knowledge of the dynamic effects of high-voltage connections and conductors.
