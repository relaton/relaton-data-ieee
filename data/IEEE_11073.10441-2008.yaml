abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of communication
    between personal telehealth cardiovascular fitness and activity monitor devices
    and compute engines (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances,
    and set top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It
    leverages appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073
    terminology, information models, application profile standards, and transport
    standards. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors
    in telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor
    of interoperability. This standard defines a common core of communication functionality
    for personal telehealth cardiovascular fitness and activity monitor devices.
