abstract:
- content: This recommended practice describes how to collect data for use in reliability,
    availability, and maintainability assessments of industrial and commercial power
    systems. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with
    limited experience in the area of reliability. It can also be an aid to all engineers
    responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.
