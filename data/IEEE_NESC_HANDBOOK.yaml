abstract:
- content: The 2023 NESC(R) Handbook is an essential companion to the Code. This Handbook
    includes text directly from the Code, which provides users an easy reference back
    to the Code, ruling-by-ruling. It gives users insight into what lies behind the
    NESC's rules and how to apply them. The Handbook was developed for use at many
    levels in the electric and communication industries, including those involved
    in system design, construction, maintenance, inspection, standards development,
    and worker training. The Handbook also discusses how the NESC Committee has developed
    the rules in the Code and responded to change proposals during the past 100 years.
    This allows users to understand how questions may have been dealt with in the
    past.
