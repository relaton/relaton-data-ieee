abstract:
- content: This Standard defines a data model for describing, referencing, and sharing
    competency definitions, primarily in the context of online and distributed learning.
    This Standard provides a way to represent formally the key characteristics of
    a competency, independently of its use in any particular context. It enables interoperability
    among learning systems that deal with competency information by providing a means
    for them to refer to common definitions with common meanings.
