abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the family on Software Engineering.
    Guidance for the development of the set of requirements, System Requirements Specification
    (SyRS), that will satisfy an expressed need is provided. Developing a SyRS includes
    the identification, organization, presentation, and modification of the requirements.
    Also addressed are the conditions for incorporating operational concepts, design
    constaints, and design confiquration requirements into the specification. This
    guide also covers the necessary characteristics and qualities of individual requirements
    and the set of all requirements.
