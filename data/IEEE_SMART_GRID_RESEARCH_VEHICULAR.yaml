abstract:
- content: 'Vehicle electrification is envisioned to be a significant component of
    the forthcoming Smart Grid. To give the vision of this area, IEEE SMART GRID VISION
    FOR VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY: 2030 AND BEYOND was published in Jan. 2014. In this
    document, a Smart Grid vision of electric vehicle technology for the next 30 years
    and beyond is presented. This webinar picks up important topics from the vision
    document. The surroundings of this area are dynamically changed, new ideas and
    challenges are continuously created in the world. However, the vision given in
    the document shows the direction and the goals in the concerning fields, and it
    still has special meanings. This webinar focuses on such a point. The interactions
    among smart grid, electric vehicle, road, and communication system are clearly
    explained. Moreover, as a use case, EV Smart Island project in Nagasaki Goto Islands
    is explained. I hope this webinar give you some hints for making further steps.'
