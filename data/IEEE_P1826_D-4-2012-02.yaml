abstract:
- content: This standard identifies Open System Interfaces for High Power Electronics
    Equipment used in Zonal Electrical Distribution Systems rated above 100 kW. The
    required Power, Monitoring, Information Exchange, Control, and Protection Interfaces
    are based on technological maturity, accepted practices and allowances for future
    technology insertions. The standard also defines how Openness of System should
    be verified and validated through rigorous assessment mechanism, interface control
    management and proactive conformance testing to enable plug-and-play operability
    independently of components origin. Standard's applications include airports,
    hospitals, major data processing centers (especially those using uninterruptible
    power supply), broadcast systems, and maritime vessels and platforms. Existing
    terrestrial utilities power systems generally do not yet contain the electronic
    power interfaces and high speed communication networks that are essential to use
    of this standard, however the standard shall be applied to upgrade existing legacy
    systems.
