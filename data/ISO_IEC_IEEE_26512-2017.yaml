abstract:
- content: 'This document was developed to assist users of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015
    or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 to acquire or supply information for users as part of the
    system or life cycle processes. It defines the documentation process from the
    acquirer''s standpoint and the supplier''s standpoint. This document covers the
    requirements for information items used in the acquisition of user documentation
    products: the acquisition plan, document specification, statement of work, request
    for proposals, and the proposal. It provides an overview of the information management
    processes which may require acquisition and supply of system or software user
    documentation products and services. It addresses the preparation of requirements
    for user documentation. These requirements are central to the user documentation
    specification and statement of work. It includes requirements for primary document
    outputs of the acquisition and supply process: the request for proposal and the
    proposal for user documentation products and services. It also discusses the use
    of a Document Plan in the acquisition and supply processes. This document is independent
    of the software tools that may be used to produce documentation, and applies to
    both printed documentation and on-screen documentation. Its guidance is applicable
    to user documentation for systems including hardware as well as software.'
