abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Jan 15, 2001. The design requirements
    for a module designated for use in spacecraft, boosters, and other highly rugged,
    conductively cooled environments are established in this standard. The requirements
    herein serve to specify the mechanical design of the module. Dimensions and tolerances
    for racks, modules, printed wiring boards, backplanes, and other connector-related
    dimensions that are specific to the use of 300-pin and 396-pin connectors are
    given. These dimensions and tolerances are designed to ensure mechanical function
    and interoperability.'
