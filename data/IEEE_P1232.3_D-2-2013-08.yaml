abstract:
- content: The AI-ESTATE User Guide provides guidance to developers of IEEE Std 1232-conformant
    applications. It uses a simple doorbell as an example system under test to illustrate
    how AI-ESTATE's static model constructs are used to form a diagnostic reasoner
    knowledge base. The guide discusses each of AI-ESTATE's knowledgebase types in
    conceptual terms, and shows how those concepts are represented in exchange files.
    It also clarifies some of the nuanced aspects of diagnostic knowledge bases in
    AI-ESTATE. The guide walks through an example reasoner session to illustrate the
    use of AI-ESTATE services.
