abstract:
- content: 'A method for the real-time exchange of synchronized phasor measurement
    data between power system equipment is defined within this standard. This includes
    the following: messaging that can be used with any suitable communication protocol
    for real-time communication between phasor measurement units (PMU), phasor data
    concentrators (PDC), and other applications; message types, contents, and their
    use as well as data types and format specifications; descriptions of typical measurement
    systems; communication options and requirements . Note that while cybersecurity
    is discussed, and while its importance is acknowledged in the overall system,
    it is considered beyond the scope of this standard.'
