abstract:
- content: A core ontology that specifies the main, most general concepts, relations,
    and axioms of robotics and automation (R&amp;A) is defined in this standard, which
    is intended as a reference for knowledge representation and reasoning in robots,
    as well as a formal reference vocabulary for communicating knowledge about R&amp;A
    between robots and humans. This standard is composed of a core ontology about
    R&amp;A, called CORA, together with other ontologies that give support to CORA.
