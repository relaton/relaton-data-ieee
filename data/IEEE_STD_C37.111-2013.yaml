abstract:
- content: Also known as IEC 60255-24 Ed.2, this standard defines a format for files
    containing transient waveform and event data collected from power systems or power
    system models. The format is intended to provide an easily interpretable form
    for use in exchanging data. The standard is for files stored on currently used
    physical media such as portable external hard drives, USB drives, flash drives,
    CD, DVD. It is not a standard for transferring data files over communication networks.
