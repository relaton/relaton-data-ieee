abstract:
- content: 'This amendment will address items discovered by users 1 related to discrepancies
    with other industry standards: Harmonize pollution levels for normal service condition.
    Further define requirements for capacitive switching class C0. Clarify required
    electrical service capability. Improve definition of interrupting time. Implement
    requirements from IEEE C37.11 which are more properly in C37.04 Align material
    imported from NEMA SG-4 with current industry practices.'
