abstract:
- content: Performance criteria are defined, and plutonium radiation is characterized.
    The specifications apply to plutonium handling and storage facilities, excluding
    reactors and irradiated fuel reprocessing facilities. This standard does not apply
    to the construction of specific instruments, nor does it specify instrumentation
    to be employed for each survey to be conducted, other than in generic terms. It
    does not define specifications for personnel dosimeters, effluent monitoring systems,
    or instruments needed in bioassay programs, nor does it define those requirements
    that may be needed to monitor emergency conditions.
