abstract:
- content: Specifications for the waveguide (including aperture dimensions, frequency
    range, cutoff frequency, etc.) are given in this standard. This standard considers
    the tolerances of the waveguide aperture dimensions and the effect these have
    on the electrical properties (in terms of return loss, transmission loss, etc.)
    of the waveguide.
