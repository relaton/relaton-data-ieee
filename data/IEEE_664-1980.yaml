abstract:
- content: Superseded by 664-1993. The current methodologies, including apparatus,
    procedures, and measurement accuracies, for determining the dynamic characteristics
    of vibration dampers and damping systems are described. Some basic guidance is
    provided regarding a given method’s strengths and weaknesses. The methodologies
    and procedures described are applicable to indoor testing only.
