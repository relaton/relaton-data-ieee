abstract:
- content: This guide applies to protective relay applications involving electric
    service to consumers that requires a transformation between the utilitys supply
    voltage and the consumers utilization voltage. It describes the factors that need
    to be considered in the design of adequate protection facilities, outlines modern
    relay practices, and provides several examples of the protection of typical utility-consumer
    interconnections.
