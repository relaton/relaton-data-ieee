abstract:
- content: An alternative physical layer (PHY) at the lower THz frequency range between
    252 GHz and 325 GHz for switched point-to-point links is defined in this amendment.
    Two PHY modes are defined that enable data rates of up to 100 Gb/s using eight
    different bandwidths between 2.16 GHz and 69.12 GHz. (The PDF of this standard
    is available at no cost to you thru the IEEE GET program http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=8066474)
