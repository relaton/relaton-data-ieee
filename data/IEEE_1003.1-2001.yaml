abstract:
- content: This standard defines a standard operating system interface and environment,
    including a command interpreter (or "shell"), and common utility programs to support
    applications portability at the source code level. It is the single common revision
    to IEEE Std 1003.1-1996, IEEE Std 1003.2-1992, and the Base Specifications of
    The Open Group Single UNIX(TM)† Specification, Version 2. This standard is intended
    to be used by both applications developers and system implementors and comprises
    four major components (each in an associated volume)
