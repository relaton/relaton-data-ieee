abstract:
- content: 'This document describes the recommended practice for online monitoring
    of large synchronous generators. Contained within this document are high-level
    discussions of each of the proposed monitoring methods, and recommended threshold
    values, whenever there is a general agreement on those values. The present standard
    does not include instrumentation that is clearly understood to belong to the protection
    scheme of the generator (e.g.: differential protection).'
