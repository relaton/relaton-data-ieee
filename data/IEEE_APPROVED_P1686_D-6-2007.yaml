abstract:
- content: This standard defines the functions and features to be provided in substation
    intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) to accommodate critical infrastructure protection
    programs. The standard addresses security regarding the access, operation, configuration,
    firmware revision and data retrieval from an IED It does not address communications
    for the purpose of power system protection (teleprotection). Encryption for the
    secure transmission of data both within and external to the substation, including
    SCADA, is not a part of this standard as this is being addressed in other efforts.
