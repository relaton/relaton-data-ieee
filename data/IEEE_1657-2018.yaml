abstract:
- content: The areas of recommended knowledge for installers and maintainers of stationary
    batteries and related systems, to the extent that they affect the battery, are
    defined in this recommended practice. Design of the dc system and sizing of the
    dc battery charger(s) are beyond the scope of this document. Only lead-acid and
    nickel-cadmium battery technologies are covered in this recommended practice.
    An outline (not necessarily in training order) of the items that should be covered
    by training programs for stationary battery installation and maintenance personnel
    is provided. Certifying trained personnel and providing its own battery technician
    training programs will not be performed by IEEE.
