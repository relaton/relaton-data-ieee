abstract:
- content: Superseded. Tests for high-voltage fuses (above 600 V), distribution enclosed
    single-pole air switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories (for AC
    distribution systems) are covered. These include enclosed, open, and open-link
    types of distribution cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting fuses;
    distribution oil cutouts; distribution enclosed single-pole air switches; power
    fuses, including current-limiting types; outdoor and indoor fuse disconnecting
    switches; fuse supports, fuse mountings, fuse hooks, fuse tongs, and fuse links
    of the type used exclusively with the above products; and removable switch blades
    for certain of the above.
