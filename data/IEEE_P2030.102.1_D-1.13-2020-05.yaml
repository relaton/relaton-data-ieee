abstract:
- content: Specific configuration requirements within the relevant Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) for implementation of the Internet
    Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol suite within a utility control system are identified
    in this standard. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to implementing
    IPsec. Promoting interoperability between products developed by different vendors
    is the primary goal in developing this standard. Configuration parameters needed
    to support the establishment and sustained operation of an IPsec Virtual Private
    Network (VPN) tunnel between two devices which have implemented IPsec conforming
    to this standard are the focus of this standard. Minimizing configuration errors
    involving IPsec implementations within utility control systems is a secondary
    goal of this standard. Product agnosticism and applicability to any device (e.g.,
    router, substation gateway, intelligent electronic device, etc.) is the intent
    of this standard, within the utility control system as the end user deems necessary
    for their unique system architecture.
