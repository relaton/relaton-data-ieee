abstract:
- content: This standard defines a method for transporting IEEE 1451 messages over
    a network using Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) to establish a light-weight,
    simplified protocol structure to handle IEEE 1451 communications, and this standard
    enables to establish a light-weight, simplified protocol structure to handle IEEE
    1451 communications over MQTT. Adding to the OASIS MQTT standards recommended
    methods, different formats of 1451.0 message carriers are defined. Moreover, time-synchronization,
    security, and other useful extensions are also defined
