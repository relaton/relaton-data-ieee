abstract:
- content: This document provides common terminology and recommended practices for
    initiating and conducting event investigations, analyzing data, producing results,
    and identifying corrective actions associated with facility personnel, processes,
    equipment and systems at nuclear facilities. The scope of event investigation
    activities addressed includes, but is not limited to, root cause analysis, which
    is an in depth investigation process used to identify primary causes of an event
    based on the systematic and consistent use of analysis tools. This recommended
    practice can be used for the investigation of all events and allows the use of
    a graduated approach to the depth of the investigation based upon the event significance.
