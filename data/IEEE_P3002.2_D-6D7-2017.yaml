abstract:
- content: Activities related to load flow analysis, including design considerations
    for new systems, analytical studies for existing systems, as well as operational
    and model validation considerations for industrial and commercial power systems
    are addressed. Load flow analysis includes steadystate power flow and voltage
    analysis along with considerations for optimal power flow calculations. The use
    of computer-aided analysis software, with a list of desirable capabilities recommended
    to conduct a modern load-flow study, is emphasized. Examples of system data requirements
    and result analysis techniques are presented.
