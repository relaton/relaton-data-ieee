abstract:
- content: This standard defines security requirements (all aspects of security including
    but not limited to authentication, authorization, privacy, integrity, device management,
    physical security and information security) for manufacturers, users, and others
    on the selection, installation, configuration and usage of hardcopy devices (HCDs)
    and systems; including printers, copiers, and multifunction devices (MFDs). This
    standard identifies security exposures for these HCDs and systems, and instructs
    manufacturers and software developers on appropriate security capabilities to
    include in their devices and systems, and instructs users on appropriate ways
    to use these security capabilities.
