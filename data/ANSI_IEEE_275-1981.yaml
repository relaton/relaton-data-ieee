abstract:
- content: This standard outlines a test procedure for comparing two or more insulation
    systems in accordance with their expected life at rated temperature. The procedure
    is limited to insulation systems for alternating-current electrical machines using
    form-wound pre-insulated stator coils and rated 6900 V and below. It is the intent
    of this procedure to evaluate insulation systems for use in usual service conditions
    with air cooling. It does not cover such special requirements as machines enclosed
    in gas atmospheres, subjected to strong chemicals, to metal dusts, or to submersion
    in liquids, etc. The procedure includes instructions for testing candidate systems
    in comparison with known systems having a proven record of service experience
    and interpretation of the results.
