abstract:
- content: This is a new standard written specifically to collect into one document
    the requirements that are common in many IEEE power switchgear standards. These
    requirements include service conditions, design (type) tests, design and construction,
    production (routine) tests, and ratings.

- content: 'This Standard collects the common requirements that are in many IEEE Power
    Switchgear Standards. These include: Service Conditions, Design (type) Tests,
    Design and Construction, Production (routine) Tests and Ratings. This standard
    applies to alternating current switchgear, designed for both indoor and outdoor
    installation and for operation at service frequencies up to and including 60 Hz
    on systems having voltages above 1000 V.'
