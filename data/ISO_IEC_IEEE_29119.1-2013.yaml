abstract:
- content: The purpose of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series of software testing standards
    is to define an internationally-agreed set of standards for software testing that
    can be used by any organization when performing any form of software testing.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 facilitates the use of the other ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 standards
    by introducing the concepts and vocabulary on which these standards are built,
    as well as providing examples of its application in practice. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1
    is informative, providing a starting point, context, and guidance for the other
    parts.
