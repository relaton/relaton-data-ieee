    This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations
    and Protective Relays. Assemblies of metal-enclosed conductors and their associated
    interconnections, enclosures, supporting structures, switches, and disconnecting
    links are addressed. Ratings, tests, construction, miscellaneous accessories,
    and loss calculation for isolated-phase buses are covered. Specifically excluded
    are busways or bus assemblies for distribution of electric power less than 600
    V, which consist of enclosed sectionalized prefabricated bus bars or associated
    structures and fittings, such as feeder busways (indoor or outdoor), plug-in busways
    (indoor only), and bus assemblies utilized at voltages in excess of 38.0 kV.'
