abstract:
- content: Activities related to short-circuit analysis, including design considerations
    for new systems, analytical studies for existing systems, as well as operational
    and model validation considerations for industrial and commercial power systems
    are addressed. Fault current calculation and device duty evaluation is included
    in short-circuit analysis. Accuracy of calculation results primarily relies on
    system modeling assumptions and methods used. The use of computer-aided analysis
    software with a list of desirable capabilities recommended to conduct a modern
    short-circuit study is emphasized. Examples of system data requirements and result
    analysis techniques are presented.
