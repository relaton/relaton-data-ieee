abstract:
- content: The purpose of the amendment is to improve the 802.11 wireless local area
    network (LAN) user experience by providing significantly higher basic service
    set (BSS) throughput for existing WLAN application areas and to enable new market
    segments for operation below 6 GHz including distribution of multiple multimedia/data
    streams.
