abstract:
- content: This standard provides a methodology for the interpretation of electric
    generating unit performance data from various systems and to facilitate comparisons
    among different systems. It also standardizes terminology and indexes for reporting
    electric generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity performance
    measures. This standard is intended to aid the electric power industry in reporting
    and evaluating electric generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity
    while recognizing the power industry's needs, including marketplace competition.
    Included are equations for equivalent demand forced outage rate (EFOR<sub>d</sub>),
    newly identified outage states, discussion of commercial availability, energy
    weighted equations for group performance indexes, definitions of outside management
    control (OMC), pooling methodologies, and time-based calculations for group performance
    indexes.
