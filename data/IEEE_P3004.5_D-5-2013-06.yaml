abstract:
- content: Information is provided for selecting the proper circuit breaker for 1
    a particular application. This recommended practice helps the application engineer
    specify the type of circuit breaker, ratings, trip functions and accessories.
    It also discusses circuit breakers for special applications, e.g., instantaneous
    only and switches. In addition, it provides information for applying circuit breakers
    at different locations in the power system, and for protecting specific components.
