abstract:
- content: Electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics and certain safety
    features of single-phase, 60 Hz, liquid-immersed, self-cooled, submersible distribution
    transformers are covered in this standard. This standard is intended for use as
    a basis for establishing the performance, electrical and mechanical interchangeability,
    and safety of the equipment covered, and to assist in the proper selection of
    such equipment.
