abstract:
- content: Procedures for demonstrating the adequacy of new Class 1E transformers,
    located in amild environment of a nuclear power generating station, to perform
    their required safety functionsunder postulated service conditions are presented.
    Single and three phase transformers rated601 V to 15 000 V for the highest voltage
    winding and up to 2500 kVA (self-cooled rating) arecovered. Because of the conservative
    approach used in the development of this new standard fornew transformers, the
    end point criteria cannot be used for in-service transformers.
