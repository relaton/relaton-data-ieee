abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice provides governance activities 1 that an organization
    that develops or uses artificial intelligence should follow to enable responsible,
    ethical and accountable development or use of artificial intelligence within its
    operations. The Recommended Practice provides a set of governance Principles that
    the governing body of the organization should consider and prioritize. It also
    provides a set of Processes that the governing body should consider to implement
    the Principles. This Recommended Practice also provides a series of case studies
    involving specific artificial intelligence applications that demonstrate how the
    Processes in the document should be used to implement the Principles of this Recommended
    Practice, including resolving tensions between Principles.
