abstract:
- content: Procedures are described in this recommended practice that may be used
    by electric utility companies and others to address complaints of interference
    caused by power line gap noise to radio, television, and other types of wireless
    communications. A discussion is included on how to determine if a noise may be
    considered as harmful interference under the FCC rules. Modern noise-locating
    techniques, equipment, and protocols are also described, including the use of
    time-domain noise signatures (sometimes referred to as signature analysis) to
    investigate and identify radio noise in the field, allowing unassociated interference
    to be ignored unless it needs to be repaired for some other reason (e.g., safety
    concerns). These techniques enable the identification of which noise source or
    sources are associated with the reported interference, thus minimizing troubleshooting
    and repair costs. Troubleshooting and repair recommendations are also included
    for once all the sources have been identified. Ways to determine and find interference
    when it is being caused by a source other than electric-utility equipment, such
    as an electronic consumer device, are also described in this recommended practice.
    The methods and techniques contained herein have been validated by decades of
    usage with positive results by a wide range of users, including but not limited
    to utilities, professional interference investigators, radio engineers, and even
    the home hobbyist.
