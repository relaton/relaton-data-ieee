abstract:
- content: 'IDEF1X<sub>97</sub> consists of two conceptual modeling languages. The
    key-style language supports data/information modeling and is downward compatible
    with the US government''s 1993 standard, FIPS PUB 184. The identity-style language
    is based on the object model with declarative rules and constraints. IDEF1X<sub>97</sub>
    identity style includes constructs for the distinct but related components of
    object abstraction: interface, requests, and realization; utilizes graphics to
    state the interface; and defines a declarative, directly executable Rule and Constraint
    Language for requests and realizations. IDEF1X<sub>97</sub> conceptual modeling
    supports implementation by relational databases, extended relational databases,
    object databases, and object programming languages. IDEF1X<sub>97</sub> is formally
    defined in terms of first order logic. A procedure is given whereby any valid
    IDEF1X<sub>97</sub> model can be transformed into an equivalent theory in first
    order logic. That procedure is then applied to a meta model of IDEF1X<sub>97</sub>
    to define the valid set of IDEF1X<sub>97</sub> models.'
