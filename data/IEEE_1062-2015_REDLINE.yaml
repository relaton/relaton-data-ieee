abstract:
- content: A set of useful quality considerations that can be selected and applied
    during one or more steps in a software acquisition process is described in this
    recommended practice. The recommended practices can be applied to software that
    runs on any computer system regardless of the size, complexity, or criticality
    of the software. The software supply chain may include integration of off-the-shelf
    (OTS), custom, or free and open source software (FOSS). Each organization or individual
    using this recommended practice will need to identify the specific quality and
    activities that need to be included within its acquisition process.
