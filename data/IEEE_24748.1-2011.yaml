abstract:
- content: This guide adopts ISO/IEC TR 24748-1:2010, which provides information on
    life cycle concepts and descriptions of the purposes and outcomes of representative
    life cycle stages. It also illustrates the use of a life cycle model for systems
    in the context of ISO/IEC 15288 and provides a corresponding illustration of the
    use of a life cycle model for software in the context of ISO/IEC 12207. ISO/IEC
    TR 24748-1:2010 additionally provides detailed discussion and advice on adapting
    a life cycle model for use in a specific project and organizational environment.
    It further provides guidance on life cycle model use by domains, disciplines and
    specialties. ISO/IEC TR 24748-1:2010 gives a detailed comparison between prior
    and current versions of ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288, as well as advice on
    transitioning from prior to current versions and on using their application guides.
    The discussion and advice are intended to provide a reference model for life cycle
    models, facilitate use of the updated ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207, and provide
    a framework for the development of updated application guides for those International
    Standards. ISO/IEC TR 24748-1:2010 is a result of the alignment stage of the harmonization
    of ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288.
