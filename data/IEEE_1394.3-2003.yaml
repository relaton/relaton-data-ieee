abstract:
- content: This standard defines a peer-to-peer data transport (PPDT) protocol between
    Serial Bus devices that implement Serial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2). The facilities
    specified include device and service discovery, self-configurable (plug and play)
    binding, and connection management.
