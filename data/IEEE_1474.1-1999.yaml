abstract:
- content: 'SUPERSEDED BY 1474.1-2004 Abstract: Performance and functional requirements
    for a communications-based train control (CBTC) system are established in this
    standard. A CBTC system is a continuous, automatic train control system utilizing
    high-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits; continuous,
    high-capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside data communications; and trainborne
    and wayside processors capable of implementing automatic train protection (ATP)
    functions, as well as optional automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train
    supervision (ATS) functions. In addition to CBTC functional requirements, this
    standard also defines headway criteria, system safety criteria, and system availability
    criteria for a CBTC system.'
