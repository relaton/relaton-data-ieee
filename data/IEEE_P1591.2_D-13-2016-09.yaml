abstract:
- content: Hardware performance, test requirements, procedures, and acceptance criteria
    for an all dielectric self-supporting overhead cable with optical fi bers are
    covered in this standard. Functional requirements, such as electrical, mechanical,
    optical fi ber, environmental and test requirements related to design, installation,
    in-service, and maintenance, including routine tests, are covered.
