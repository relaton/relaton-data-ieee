abstract:
- content: The physical layer (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) sublayer specifications
    for low-data-rate wireless connectivity with fixed, portable, and moving devices
    with no battery or very limited battery consumption requirements are defined in
    this standard. In addition, the standard provides modes that allow for precision
    ranging. PHYs are defined for devices operating in a variety of geographic regions.
