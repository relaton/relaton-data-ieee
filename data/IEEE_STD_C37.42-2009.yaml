abstract:
- content: 'This standard establishes specifications for high voltage (above 1000
    volts) expulsion type distribution class fuses, fuse cutouts, fuse disconnecting
    switches, their associated fuse links and disconnecting cutouts, and accessories
    for these devices. All of these devices are intended for use on alternating current
    distribution systems. These specifications apply to the following specific types
    of equipment: a) Open and enclosed types of fuses and fuse cutouts b) Open and
    enclosed fuse disconnecting switches c) Fuse links of the type used exclusively
    with distribution class fuses, fuse cutouts, and fuse disconnecting switches.
    d) Open-link types of fuses, cutouts, and their associated fuse links e) Open
    and enclosed types of disconnecting cutouts f) Fuse supports, fuse mountings and
    fuse hooks of the type used exclusively with distribution class fuses, fuse cutouts,
    fuse disconnecting switches, and disconnecting cutouts. g) Fuse holders and removable
    switch blades of the type used exclusively with distribution class fuse supports.
    h) Mounting brackets used for distribution class equipment and other accessories.'
