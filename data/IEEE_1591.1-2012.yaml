abstract:
- content: Hardware performance, test requirements, procedures, and acceptance criteria
    for a transmission line overhead ground wire (also known as shield wire, static
    wire, earth wire, sky wire) with optical fibers commonly known as optical ground
    wire (OPGW) are covered. Functional requirements, such as electrical, mechanical,
    optical fiber, environmental, and test requirements related to design, installation,
    in service, and maintenance, including routine tests, are included.
