abstract:
- content: Instructions for conducting generally applicable and accepted tests to
    determine the performance characteristics of synchronous machines are contained
    in this guide. Although the tests described are applicable in general to synchronous
    generators, synchronous motors (larger than fractional horsepower), synchronous
    condensers, and synchronous frequency changers, the descriptions make reference
    primarily to synchronous generators and synchronous motors.
