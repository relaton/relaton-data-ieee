abstract:
- content: Guidance is provided for health-care organizations in evaluating the radiated
    RF electromagnetic immunity of their existing inventories of medical devices to
    their existing inventories of RF transmitters, as well as to RF transmitters that
    are commonly available. This recommended practice can also be used for newly purchased
    medical devices and RF transmitters, as well as for pre-purchase evaluation. It
    applies to medical devices used in health-care facilities and to portable transmitters
    with a rated power output of 8 W or less. It does not apply to implantable medical
    devices, transport environments such as ambulances and helicopters, or to RF transmitters
    rated at more than 8 W.
