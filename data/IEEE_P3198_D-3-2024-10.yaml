abstract:
- content: A method for evaluating the fairness of machine learning is specified in
    this standard. Multiple causes contribute to the unfairness of machine learning.
    These causes of machine learning unfairness are categorized. The widely recognized
    and used definitions of machine learning fairness are presented. Various metrics
    corresponding to the definitions, and how to calculate the metrics are specified
    in this standard. Detailed conditions and procedures to set up the tests for evaluating
    machine learning fairness are given by the test cases in this document.
