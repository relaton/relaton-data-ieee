abstract:
- content: This standard applies to the dimensions for all types of shaft couplings
    and shaft runout tolerances for hydraulic turbines and generators. Shafts and
    couplings included in this standard are used for both horizontal and vertical
    connections between generators and turbines in hydroelectric installations.
