abstract:
- content: This standard addresses the exchange of vital data about public safety
    issues involved in transportation-related events, through common incident management
    message sets. Message sets specified are consistent with the National Intelligent
    Transportation Systems Architecture and are described using Abstract Syntax Notation
    One (ASN.1 or ASN) syntax. This standard comprises one companion standard of the
    family of incident management standards centered around a base standard, IEEE
    Std 1512-2000.
