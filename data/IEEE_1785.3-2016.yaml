abstract:
- content: Recommendations for summarizing the performance and the expected uncertainty
    of the reflection coefficient of rectangular-waveguide apertures and interfaces
    for 110 GHz and above are provided in this recommended practice. The information
    provided also facilitates the development of a complete uncertainty analysis for
    the performance of rectangular waveguide interfaces. For example, it includes
    the dimensional information essential for calculating the uncertainty of both
    reflection and transmission coefficients through interfaces provided by different
    manufacturers if both follow this recommended practice.
