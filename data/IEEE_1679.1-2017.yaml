abstract:
- content: Guidance for an objective evaluation of lithium-based energy storage technologies
    by a potential user for any stationary application is provided in this document.
    IEEE Std 1679-2010, IEEE Recommended Practice for the Characterization and Evaluation
    of Emerging Energy Storage Technologies in Stationary Applications is to be used
    in conjunction with this document. Secondary (rechargeable) electro-chemistries
    with lithium ions as the active species exchanged between the electrodes during
    charging and discharging are included in the category of lithium-based batteries
    for the purposes of this document. Lithium-ion, lithium-ion polymer, lithium-metal
    polymer, and lithium-sulfur batteries are examples of secondary lithium-based
    batteries. Primary (non-rechargeable) lithium batteries are beyond the scope of
    this document. A technology description, information on aging and failure modes,
    a discussion on safety issues, evaluation techniques, and regulatory issues are
    provided in this document. Sizing, installation, maintenance, and testing techniques
    are not covered, except insofar as they may influence the evaluation of a lithium-based
    battery for its intended application.
