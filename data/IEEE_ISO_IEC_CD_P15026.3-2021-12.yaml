abstract:
- content: This part of ISO/IEC 15026 specifies the concept of integrity levels with
    corresponding integrity level requirements that are required to be met in order
    to show the achievement of the integrity level. It places requirements on and
    recommends methods for defining and using integrity levels and their corresponding
    integrity level requirements. It covers systems, software products, and their
    elements, as well as relevant external dependencies.
