abstract:
- content: The object of this standard is to establish standard test procedures for
    semiconductor charged-particle detectors. These detectors are in wide-spread use
    for the detection and high resolution spectroscopy of charged particles. It is
    desirable to maintain standard test procedures so that measurements may have the
    same meaning to all manufacturers and users. Not all tests described in this standard
    are mandatory, but tests which are used to specify performance shall be performed
    in accordance with the procedures described herein.
