abstract:
- content: Cybersecurity measures require that a balance be achieved between technical
    feasibility and economic feasibility and that this balance addresses the risks
    expected to be present at a substation. Further, cybersecurity measures must be
    designed and implemented in such a manner that access and operation to legitimate
    activities is not impeded, particularly during times of emergency or restoration
    activity. This standard presents a balance of the above factors.
