abstract:
- content: Requirements for interrupter switches, interrupters or interrupting aids
    used on or attached to switches rated for high-voltage ac above 1000 V and used
    indoors, outdoors, or in enclosures for non-fault current interrupting for which
    an interrupting duty is assigned are covered in this standard. It includes preferred
    ratings, construction, application, loading, installation, and operation and maintenance
    guidelines. This standard does not apply to load-break separable insulated connectors,
    circuit breakers, circuit switchers, metal enclosed switchgear, pad-mounted switchgear,
    reclosers, sectionalizers or otherre switching devices that are covered by otherre
    IEEE standards.
