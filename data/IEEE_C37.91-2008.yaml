abstract:
- content: This guide is intended to provide protection engineers and other readers
    with guidelines for protecting three-phase power transformers of more than 5 MVA
    rated capacity and operating at voltages exceeding 10 kV. In some cases, a user
    may apply the techniques described in this guide for protecting transformers of
    less than 5 MVA ratings or operating at voltages less than 10 kV. Information
    to assist protection engineers in applying properly relays and other devices to
    protect transformers used in transmission and distribution systems is provided
    in this guide. General philosophy, practical applications, and economic considerations
    involved in power transformer protection are discussed. Emphasis is placed on
    practical applications. Types of faults in transformers are described. Technical
    problems with the protection systems, including the behavior of current transformers
    during system faults, are discussed. Associated problems, such as fault clearing
    and reenergization, are discussed as well.
