abstract:
- content: The architecture of a distributed, platform-independent system that manages
    removable media, including both disk and tape, using robotic and manual methods
    are specified. The general schema for managing media, the components of the software
    system, and the supporting data model used by the software system for managing
    this media are described by this standard. Details of major components of the
    system are specified by companion standards.
