- content: The Recommended Practice for the Provenance of Indigenous Peoples’ Data
    establishes a common set of parameters for the provenance of Indigenous Peoples'
    data. This Recommended Practice supports appropriate disclosure of Indigenous
    Peoples' relationships and/or links to all data. Provenance of Indigenous Peoples’
    Data includes information that facilitates Indigenous Peoples' governance, decision-making,
    participation, collaboration, and engagement in and for current and future uses
    of Indigenous Peoples’ data.
