abstract:
- content: Service conditions, electrical ratings, thermal ratings and environmental
    testing requirements are defined for communications networking devices to be installed
    in electric power substations. This standard establishes a common reproducible
    basis for designing and evaluating communications networking devices and the communications
    ports of protective relays for use in this harsh environment.
