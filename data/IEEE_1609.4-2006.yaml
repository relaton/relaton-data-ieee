abstract:
- content: Multi-channel operation is an extension to the IEEE 802.11 WAVE mode that
    describes how to support a multi-channel system with the IEEE 802.11 medium access
    control (MAC) and physical layers (PHYs) via a control channel (CCH) and multiple
    service channels (SCHs). Specifically, the multi-channel operation (channel coordination)
    provides mechanisms for prioritized access, channel routing and coordination,
    and data transmission.
