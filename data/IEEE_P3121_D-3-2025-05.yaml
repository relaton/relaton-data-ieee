abstract:
- content: A non-intrusive state monitoring framework for embedded devices in industrial
    control systems is provided in this standard. The techniques covered include analog
    signal acquisition, analog data processing, model training, anomaly detection,
    and human-machine interface. The analog signal acquisition is to gather various
    types of sensor signals from the embedded devices. The analog data processing
    is to process the collected data to extract features. The model training is to
    train a classification model that can identify different types of attacks. The
    anomaly detection is to implement, manage, and secure the detection engine. The
    human-machine interface is to provide alarm information and get feedback.
