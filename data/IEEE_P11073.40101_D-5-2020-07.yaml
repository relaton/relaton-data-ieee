abstract:
- content: This standard defines for Personal Health Devices (PHDs) and Point-of-Care
    Devices (PoCDs) an iterative, systematic, scalable, and auditable approach to
    identification of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and estimation of risk. The standard
    presents one approach to iterative vulnerability assessment using the Spoofing,
    Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure (STRIDE) classification scheme
    and embedded Common Vulnerability Scoring System (eCVSS) scoring system. The assessment
    includes system context, system decomposition, pre-mitigation scoring, mitigation,
    post-mitigation score and iterates until the remaining vulnerabilities are reduced
    to an acceptable level of risk.
