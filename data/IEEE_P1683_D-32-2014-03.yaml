abstract:
- content: Functional design recommendations and field practices for motor control
    centers (single- and three-phase 50 Hz and 60 Hz and dc) are provided in this
    guide. The features and practices described in this guide are intended to help
    reduce the probability that an incident will occur due to shock or arc flash hazards
    when qualified persons are performing certain activities. The recommendations
    within this guide are intended to augment the existing requirements of applicable
    standards for motor control centers, e.g., NEMA ICS 18 Motor Control Centers,
    UL 845 Motor Control Centers, NMX-J-353-ANCE, and CSA C22.2 No. 254. This guide
    also providesrecommendations for interface relationships between the specifier,
    manufacturer, installer, and user for safety-related concerns. It also provides
    a framework from which specifiers/users can select specific MCC features and system
    characteristics that are applicable to their specific situation and needs.The
    recommendations in this guide complement safety requirements and procedures as
    stipulated by workplace safety standards and site practices and site procedures,
    e.g., NFPA 70E Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, CSA Z462 Workplace
    Electrical Safety Standard, site practice on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE),
    etc.
