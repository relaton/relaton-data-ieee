abstract:
- content: The continuing expansion and modernization program in the cement industry
    has placed an increasingimportance on the current plant power distribution system.
    Increasing plant capacity accompaniedby larger kilns, grinding mills, crushers,
    and the increasing use of automatic controlshas placed greater stress on the adequacy
    and reliability of the distribution system. Safety, capacity, reliability, and
    low maintenance - all at a reasonable cost - are the requirements of the cement
    plant power distribution system.
