abstract:
- content: The purpose of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series is to define an internationally-agreed
    set of standards for software testing that can be used by any organization when
    performing any form of software testing. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-5 defines keyword-driven
    testing, which is an approach to describing test cases in a modular way. This
    standard explains the main concepts and attributes of keyword-driven testing and
    is applicable to all those who want to create keyword-driven test specifications,
    create corresponding frameworks, or build test automation based on keywords. This
    standard defines requirements on frameworks for keyword-driven testing to enable
    test engineers to share their test artefacts, such as test cases, test data, keywords,
    or complete test specifications. It also defines minimum requirements for tools
    supporting keyword-driven testing and defines requirements on a common data exchange
    format to ensure that tools from different vendors can exchange their data (e.g.
    test cases, test data and test results).
