abstract:
- content: The guide covers modern power transformers rated above 100 MVA, three-phase
    equivalent and 65&#176;C rise. The general approach is tutorial. Four different
    types of loading, that is, normal life expectancy loading, planned loading beyond
    nameplate rating, long-time emergency loading, and short-time emergency loading,
    are considered. The various effects of loading a transformer in excess of its
    nameplate rating are discussed. Temperature and maximum loading limitations are
    suggested.
