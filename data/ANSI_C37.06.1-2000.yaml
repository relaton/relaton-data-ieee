abstract:
- content: The purpose of this guide is to provide suggested values of fast transient
    recovery voltage rise time ratings. The proposed ratings were suggested by the
    IEEE Switchgear Committee, and apply ONLY to currents in the ranges of 7 percent
    to 30 percent of Rated Short-Circuit Current. The TRVs for currents more than
    or equal to 60% of rated short-circuit current remain the same as for general
    purpose circuit breakers. Circuit breakers not identified by the manufacturer
    as "definite purpose for fast transient recovery voltage rise times"shall be understood
    to be "general purpose circuit breakers," meeting the C37.06 standard TRV requirements
    in table 1, 2, or 3 as appropriate.
