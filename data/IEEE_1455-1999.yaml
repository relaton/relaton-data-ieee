abstract:
- content: '" Those characteristics of a dedicated short-range communications (DSRC)
    system thatare independent of the Physical and Data Link Layers (ISO model Layers
    1 and 2) are specified.The required and optional features of the roadside equipment
    (RSE) and the onboard equipment(OBE) are specified. In addition, the Applications
    Layer (ISO model Layer 7) services and protocols,the RSE resource manager, the
    corresponding OBE command interpreter, and the application-spe-cific messages
    are all specified. Standard supports and guidelines are provided for implementingsecure
    DSRC systems. "'
