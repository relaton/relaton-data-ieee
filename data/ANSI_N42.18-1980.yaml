abstract:
- content: Installed instrumentation for measuring the quantity or rate, or both,
    of release of radionuclides in the effluent streams, and to provide documentation
    useful for scientific and legal purposes, is covered. Recommendations for the
    selection of instrumentation are provided. This standard applies to continuous
    monitors that measure normal releases, detect inadvertent releases, show general
    trends, and enunciate radiation levels that have exceeded predetermined values.
