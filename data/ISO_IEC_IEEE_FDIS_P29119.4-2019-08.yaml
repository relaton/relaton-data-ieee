abstract:
- content: The purpose of this part of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 is to provide an International
    Standard that defines software test design techniques (also known as test case
    design techniques or test methods) that can be used within the test design and
    implementation process that is defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2. This part of ISO/IEC/IEEE
    29119 does not describe a process for test design and implementation; instead,
    it describes a set of techniques that can be used within the test design and implementation
    process defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2. The intent is to describe a series of
    techniques that have wide acceptance in the software testing industry. The test
    design techniques presented in this part of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 can be used to
    derive test cases that, when executed, generate evidence that test item requirements
    have been met or that defects are present in a test item (i.e. that requirements
    have not been met). Risk-based testing could be used to determine the set of techniques
    that are applicable in specific (risk-based testing is covered in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    29119-1 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2).
