abstract:
- content: Supersedes IEEE Std 488.1-2003. This standard applies to interface systems
    used to interconnect both programmable and nonprogrammable electronic measuring
    apparatus with other apparatus and accessories necessary to assemble instrumentation
    systems. It applies to the interface of instrumentation systems, or portions of
    them, in which the a) Data exchanged among the interconnected apparatus is digital
    (as distinct from analog) b) Number of devices that may be interconnected by one
    contiguous bus does not exceed 15 c) Total transmission path lengths over the
    interconnecting cables does not exceed 20 m d) Data rate among devices does not
    exceed 8 000 000 B/s The basic functional specifications of this standard may
    be used in digital interface applications that require longer distances, more
    devices, increased noise immunity, or combinations of these. Different electrical
    and mechanical specifications may be required (for example, symmetrical circuit
    configurations, high threshold logic, special connectors, or cable configurations)
    for these extended applications.
