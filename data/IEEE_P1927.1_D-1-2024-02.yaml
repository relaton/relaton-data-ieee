abstract:
- content: This 1 standard specifies a methodological framework for providing computational
    resources and the network that interconnects them in an energy efficient way.
    The framework utilizes virtualization to allow multiple secondary operators share
    and slice the resources of a physical infrastructure owned by a larger operator
    known as the infrastructure provider (InP). The purpose of this standard is to
    assess and improve the energy efficiency of joint network and data center virtualization.
