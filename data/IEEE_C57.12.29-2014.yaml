abstract:
- content: 'Conformance tests and requirements for the integrity of above-grade pad-mounted
    enclosures for application in coastal environments that contain apparatus energized
    in excess of 600 V and that may be exposed to the public are described. These
    include, but are not limited to,the following types of equipment enclosures: pad-mounted
    capacitors or inductors, pad-mounted distribution transformers, pad-mounted junction
    enclosures, pad-mounted metering equipment, pad-mounted switchgear, and pad-mounted
    voltage regulators.'
