abstract:
- content: Characteristics are provided in this standard relating to performance,
    limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and guidance to assist in
    the proper selection of sealed dry-type transformers having a high voltage of
    at least 601 V. Specific rating combinations are described in the range from 500
    kVA to 5000 kVA inclusive, with voltage ratings as described in IEEE Std C57.12.01™.
    The fill gases used in these sealed dry-type power transformers are not explicitly
    defined. This standard does not apply to other types of transformers, such as
    those transformers described as exceptions in IEEE Std C57.12.01, as well as ventilated
    dry-type and non-ventilated dry-type transformers.
