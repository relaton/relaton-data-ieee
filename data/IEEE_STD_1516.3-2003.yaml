abstract:
- content: The processes and procedures that should be followed by users of the High
    Level Archi-tecture (HLA) to develop and execute federations are defined in this
    recommended practice. Thisrecommended practice is not intended to replace low-level
    management and systems engineeringpractices native to HLA user organizations,
    but is rather intended as a higher-level framework intowhich such practices can
    be integrated and tailored for specific uses.
