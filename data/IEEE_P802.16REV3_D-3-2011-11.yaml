abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the air interface, including the medium access
    control layer(MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of combined fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint
    broadbandwireless access (BWA) systems providing multiple services. The MAC is
    structured to supportmultiple physical layer (PHY) specifications, each suited
    to a particular operational environment.The standard enables rapid worldwide deployment
    of innovative, cost ffective, and nteroperable multivendor broadband wireless
    access products, acilitates competition in roadband access by providing alternatives
    to wireline broadband ccess, encourages onsistent worldwide spectrum allocations,
    and accelerates the ommercialization of broadband ireless access systems. The
    standard is a revision of IEEEE Std 02.16-2004, and onsolidates material from
    IEEE Std 802.16eTM-2005, IEEE 802.16 004/Cor1-2005, IEEE 02.16fTM-2005, and IEEE
    Std 802.16gTM-2007, along with additional maintenance items and nhancements to
    the management information base specifications. This revision supersedes nd makes
    obsolete IEEE Std 802.16-2004 and all of its subsequent amendments and orrigenda.
