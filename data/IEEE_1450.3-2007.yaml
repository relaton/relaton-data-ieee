abstract:
- content: The STIL environment supports transferring tester-independent test programs
    to a specific automated testing equipment (ATE) system. Although native STIL data
    are tester independent, the actual process of mapping the test program onto tester
    resources may be critical, and it is necessary to be able to completely and unambiguously
    specify how the STIL programs and patterns are mapped onto the tester resources.
    TRC (which stands for either tester resource constraints or tester rules checking,
    depending on the usage) is an extension to the STIL language to facilitate this
    operation.
