abstract:
- content: A framework of scientific knowledge graphs is proposed in this guide. This
    guide divides the stakeholders of scientific knowledge graphs into scientific
    data suppliers, scientific knowledge graph technology suppliers, scientific knowledge
    graph integrators, scientific knowledge graph users, and scientific knowledge
    graph ecological partners. The main activities of data governance, construction,
    integration, application, and ecological development of the stakeholders are described
    in detail.
