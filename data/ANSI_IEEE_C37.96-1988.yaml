abstract:
- content: Guidance in applying relay protection to squirrel-cage and wound-rotor
    induction motors and synchronous motors is provided. The generally accepted forms
    of motor protection are reviewed, and the use of relays and devices, singly and
    in combination, is summarized so that the user can select the necessary equipment
    to obtain adequate motor protection. This guide is concerned primarily with the
    protection of three-phase integral horsepower motors and variable-speed motors
    where specifically indicated. It does not detail the protective requirements of
    all motors in every situation. The recommendations are of a general nature, designed
    to cover the usual or typical motor installations.
