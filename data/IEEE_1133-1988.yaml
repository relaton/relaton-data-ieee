abstract:
- content: This Guide is based on the knowledge and experience of manufacturers, researchers,
    and end users of nonceramic insulating products that are electrically stressed
    in outdoor environments. The standard discusses the characteristics of nonceramic
    materials that are needed for long-term reliability in these applications. The
    standard makes recommendations for principles of evaluation and tests used in
    the screening and selection of materials. The judicious use of this standard will
    significantly improve the probability of success in the applications selected.
