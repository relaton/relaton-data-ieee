abstract:
- content: This application guide covers procedures and 1 calculations necessary to
    apply the standard transient recovery voltage (TRV) ratings for ac high-voltage
    circuit breakers rated above 1000 V. The breaking capability limits of these circuit
    breakers are determined to a great degree by the TRV. The TRV ratings are compared
    with typical system TRV duties. Examples of TRV calculation are given with suggested
    options if the TRV duty exceeds the TRV ratings of the circuit breaker.
