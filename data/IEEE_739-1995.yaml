abstract:
- content: This recommended practice serves as an engineering guide for use in electrical
    design for energy conservation. It provides a standard design practice to assist
    engineers in evaluating electrical options from an energy standpoint. It establishes
    engineering techniques and procedures to allow efficiency optimization in the
    design and operation of an electrical system considering all aspects (safety,
    costs, environment, those occupying the facility, management needs, etc.).
