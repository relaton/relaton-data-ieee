abstract:
- content: 'This guide provides maintenance testing and failure analysis guidance
    for form-wound, squirrel cage, induction machinery rated up to 15 kV. It addresses
    the following machine systems: Stator (Winding and Core) Rotor (Winding and Core)
    Vibration and Noise Bearings and Shafts Structure, Frame Ventilation Accessories.
    This guide is intended for use by personnel at the facility or corporate office
    responsible for the operation and maintenance of large induction machines. It
    is a guide to aid the thought processes and procedures necessary to determine
    root causes for failures.'
