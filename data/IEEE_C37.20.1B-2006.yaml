abstract:
- content: This amendment addresses additional requirements of auxiliary power wiring
    and control wiring within dc switchgear of traction power substations with rated
    maximum voltage up to 3200 volts dc. This amendment provides control and power
    wiring methods for dc traction power switchgear intended to increase reliability
    of the operation of the equipment, improve protection, reduce maintenance cost
    and initial cost, and improve overall performance of the dc traction power switchgear.
