abstract:
- content: Withdrawn January 2012. This guide covers various approaches to good inspection
    practices for the construction of overhead transmission lines. Inspection responsibilities
    and reporting as well as inspection of various overhead transmission line components
    are discussed. The guide is intended to be used as a reference for those involved
    in the ownership, design, and construction of overhead transmission lines.
