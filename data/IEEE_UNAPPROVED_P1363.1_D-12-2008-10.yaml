abstract:
- content: Specifications of common public-key cryptographic techniques based on 1
    hard problems over lattices supplemental to those considered in IEEE 1363 and
    IEEE P1363a, including mathematical primitives for secret value (key) derivation,
    public-key encryption, identification and digital signatures, and cryptographic
    schemes based on those primitives. Specifications of related cryptographic parameters,
    public keys and private keys. Class of computer and communications systems is
    not restricted.
