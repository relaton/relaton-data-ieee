abstract:
- content: Design tests for relays and relay systems that relate to the immunity of
    this equipment to radiated electromagnetic interference from transceivers are
    specified in this standard. Field strength, test frequencies, modulation, sweep
    rates, equipment setup and connection, test procedures, criteria for acceptance,
    and documentation for test results are described. This standard has been harmonized
    with IEC standards where consensus could be reached.
