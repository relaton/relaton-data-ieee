abstract:
- content: This standard provides a uniform approach to the classification of software
    anomalies, regardless of when they originate or when they are encountered within
    the project, product, or system lifecycle. Classification data can be used for
    a variety of purposes, including defect causal analysis, project management, and
    software process improvement (e.g., to reduce the likelihood of defect insertion
    and/or increase the likelihood of early defect detection).
