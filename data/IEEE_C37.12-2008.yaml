abstract:
- content: These specifications apply to all indoor and outdoor types of ac high-voltage
    circuit breakers rated above 1000 volts. This document is issued only as a guide
    for use in compiling specifications for ac high-voltage circuit breakers. The
    imperative mode of the language is illustrative of that used in specifications.
