abstract:
- content: 'The objective of this book is to present the fundamentals of reliability
    analysis applied to the planning and design of industrial and commercial electric
    power distribution systems. The intended audience for this material is primarily
    consulting engineers and plant electrical engineers and technicians. The design
    of reliable industrial and commercial power distribution systems is important
    because of the high cost associated with power outages. It is necessary to consider
    the cost of power outages when making design decisions for new power distribution
    systems as well as to have the ability to make quantitative “cost-versus-reliability”
    trade-off studies. The lack of credible data concerning equipment reliability
    and the cost of power outages has hindered engineers in making such studies. This
    edition of the IEEE Std 493 overcomes these obstacles. Remarks: Revision of IEEE
    Std 493-1997'
