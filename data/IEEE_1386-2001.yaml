abstract:
- content: Administratively withdrawn January 2007. The mechanics of a common mezzanine
    card (CMC) family are defined in this standard.Mezzanine cards, designed to this
    standard, can be used interchangeably on VME, VME64 andVME64x boards, CompactPCI
    ¤ boards, Multibus ¤ I and II boards, desktop computers, portablecomputers, servers,
    and other similar types of applications. Mezzanine cards can provide modularfront
    panel I/O, backplane I/O or general function expansion or a combination for host
    computers.Single, wide mezzanine cards are 75 mm wide by 150 mm deep by 8.2 mm
    high.
