abstract:
- content: This standard establishes the minimum set of requirements for end-to-end
    software testing automation tools. Also, this standard can be used to guide users
    and industries to prepare and perform different types of automated testing on
    software integration environments. These tools can help users and industries in
    streamlining the software test automation processes, leading to reducing cost
    and effort on test development, execution and maintenance.
