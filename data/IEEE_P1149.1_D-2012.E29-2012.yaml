abstract:
- content: Circuitry that may be built into an integrated circuit to assist in the
    test, maintenance and support of assembled printed circuit boards and the test
    of internal circuits is defined. The circuitry includes a standard interface through
    which instructions and test data are communicated. A set of test features is defined,
    including a boundary-scan register, such that the component is able to respond
    to a minimum set of instructions designed to assist with testing of assembled
    printed circuit boards. Also, a language is defined that allows rigorous structural
    description of the component-specific aspects of such testability features, and
    a second language is defined that allows rigorous procedural description of how
    the testability features may be used.
