abstract:
- content: This standard sets forth the requirements for a calibration program to
    control and verify the accuracy of M&amp;TE (measuring and test equipment) which
    is used to assure that important parts of nuclear power generating stations are
    in conformance with prescribed technical requirements, and that data provided
    by testing, inspection, or maintenance are valid. These important parts include
    those structures, systems, and components whose satisfactory performance is required;
    for the plant to operate safely, to prevent accidents that could cause undue risk
    to the health and safety of the public, or to mitigate the consequences of such
    accidents if they were to occur. This standard is intended to be used in conjunction
    with American National Standard Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Nuclear
    Power Plants, ANSI N45.2-1971.
