abstract:
- content: Several use cases and services are defined, namely, handover between heterogeneous
    networks, home energy management system, software-defined radio access networks
    (SDRANs), radio resource management (RRM), and device-to-device (D2D) communication
    service that need to be implemented in conjunction with the media independent
    services (MIS) framework as specified in IEEE Std 802.21(TM)-2017
