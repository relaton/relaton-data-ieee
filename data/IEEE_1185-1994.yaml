abstract:
- content: Installation methods to improve cable installation practices in generating
    stations are provided. These include cable lubrication methods, conduit-cable
    pulling charts, pull rope selection criteria, pulling attachment methods, and
    alternative methods to traditional cable pulling tension monitoring. This guide
    supplements IEEE Std 422-1986 and IEEE Std 690-1984, which provide specific cable
    installation limits. This guide may also be of benefit to cable pulling crews
    in commercial and industrial facilities when similar cable types and raceways
    are used.
