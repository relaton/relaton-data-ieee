abstract:
- content: Test processes determine whether the development products of a given activity
    conform to the requirements of that activity and whether the system and/or software
    satisfies its intended use and user needs. Testing process tasks are specified
    for different integrity levels. These process tasks determine the appropriate
    breadth and depth of test documentation. The documentation elements for each type
    of test documentation can then be selected. The scope of testing encompasses software-based
    systems, computer software, hardware and their interfaces. This standard applies
    to software-based systems being developed, maintained, or reused (legacy, COTS,
    Non-Developmental Items). The term software also includes firmware, microcode
    and documentation. Test processes can include inspection, analysis, demonstration,
    verification and validation of software and software-based system products. (IEEE
    829-2008 is superseded by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1-2013, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2-2013,
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3-2013 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4-2015. )
