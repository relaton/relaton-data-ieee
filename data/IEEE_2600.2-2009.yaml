abstract:
- content: This standard is for a protection profile for hardcopy devices in a commercial
    information processing environment in which a moderate level of document security,
    network security, and security assurance are required. Typically, the day-to-day
    proprietary and nonproprietary information needed to operate an enterprise will
    be handled by this environment. This environment will be known as "Operational
    Environment B".
