abstract:
- content: This standard specifies procedures, managed objects, and protocols for
    bridges and end systems that provide identification and replication of packets
    for redundant transmission, identification of duplicate packets, and elimination
    of duplicate packets. It is not concerned with the creation of the multiple paths
    over which the duplicates are transmitted.
