abstract:
- content: The interface system on which this standard is based was developed by the
    ESONE Committee of European Laboratories with the collaboration of the NIM Committee
    of the U. S. Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). This standard
    is supplementary to IEEE Std 583-1975 Modular Instrumentation and Digital Interface
    System (CAMAC), and is based on ERDA Reports TID-25876, March 1972 (corresponding
    to ESONE Report EUR 4600e) and TID-25877. The mandatory features in this standard
    are identical to those in the proceeding reports and in the corresponding publication
    of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) that is currently being
    processed. A serial highway interface system, also intended for use with IEEE
    Std 583-1975, is defined in IEEE Std 595-1976, Serial Highway Interface System.
