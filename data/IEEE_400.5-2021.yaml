abstract:
- content: The recommended practices and procedures for direct voltage acceptance
    and maintenance testing of shielded, insulated power cable systems rated 5 kV
    and above for dc service are presented in this guide. It applies to all types
    of power cable systems used for transmission of dc voltages and can include laminated
    or extruded cables designed for dc service. The tabulated test levels assume that
    the cable systems have an effectively grounded neutral system or a grounded metallic
    shield.
