abstract:
- content: 'The DNP3 protocol structure, functions, and application alternatives and
    the corresponding conformance test procedures are specified. In addition to defining
    the structure and operation of DNP3, three application levels that are interoperable
    are defined. The simplest application is for low-cost distribution feeder devices,
    and the most complex is for full-featured master stations. The intermediate application
    level is for substation and other intermediate devices. The protocol is suitable
    for operation on a variety of communication media consistent with the makeup of
    most electric power communication systems. Keywords: Distributed Network Protocol
    (DNP3), distribution automation, distribution feeder, electric power communication
    systems, master station, substation automation'
