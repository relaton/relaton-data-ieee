abstract:
- content: This International Standard establishes a common process framework for
    describing the life cycle of man-made systems. It defines a set of processes and
    associated terminology for the full life cycle, including conception, development,
    production, utilization, support and retirement. This standard also supports the
    definition, control, assessment, and improvement of these processes. These processes
    can be applied concurrently, iteratively, and recursively to a system and its
    elements throughout the life cycle of a system.
