abstract:
- content: The physical and electromechanical requirements for relaxor-based piezoelectric
    single crystals of lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) and lead zinc
    niobate-lead titanate (PZN-PT) solid solutions of perovskite structure, with poling
    along the crystallographic c-axis (i.e., the [001]-direction), that are intended
    for fabrication into single plates, multilayer plate devices, and composites with
    other passive materials for use in medical, industrial, and military transducers,
    actuators, and sensors are covered in this standard. Definitions of terms and
    recommended practices for measuring the physical and electromechanical properties
    of these materials are also included in this standard.
