abstract:
- content: 'The basic operation requirements and air-to-ground channel model of emergency
    cellular communication system based on large fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system
    are presented. The requirements are described in six categories: system architecture,
    UAV platform requirements, airborne emergency base station requirements, airborne
    satellite communication requirements and system operation requirements. Airborne
    emergency base station requirements include basic requirements, limited access
    capability requirements, capacity requirements, back-haul link requirements and
    reliability. The requirements of airborne satellite communication include technical
    index requirements, physical characteristic requirements, electrical characteristic
    requirements, reliability requirements, interface requirements and ground station
    requirements. Last but not least, system operation requirements refer to business
    requirements, business continuity requirements, and business continuous coverage
    area requirements.'
