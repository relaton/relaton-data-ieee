abstract:
- content: A series of analyses of various problems regarding the interpretation of
    the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) was carried out by VHDL experts
    on the VHDL Analysis and Standardization Group, the working group that developed
    the original IEEE Std 1076-1987. The results of these deliberations are presented
    in this document. The intent is to give the VHDL community reasonable ways of
    interpreting the unclear portions of the standard.
