abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-3 provides guidance on the application of the software
    life cycle processes standard, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. This document establishes
    guidance to implement a common framework for software life cycle processes, with
    well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by the software industry. This
    document provides guidance on defining, controlling, and improving software life
    cycle processes within an organization or a project. It recommends methods and
    approaches suitable for a variety of life cycle models. The guidance emphasizes
    the importance of establishing a strategy, planning, and the involvement of stakeholders,
    with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. Its purpose is to help
    ensure consistency in system concepts and life cycle concepts, models, stages,
    processes, process application, key points of view, adaptation and use in various
    domains. This document concentrates on specific guidance for the Technical processes
    and how they can be effectively used during the software life cycle. It is intended
    to be useful in a variety of software life cycle situations, including the use
    of agile methods.
