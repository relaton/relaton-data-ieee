abstract:
- content: 'Qualification methods for Class 1E vented lead acid batteries and racks
    to be used in nuclear power generating stations outside primary containment are
    described in this standard. Qualifications required by IEEE Std 308&#8482; can
    be demonstrated by using the procedures in this standard in accordance with IEEE
    Std 323&#8482;. The application of batteries in nuclear power generating stations
    can be divided into two sections: duty cycles equal to or less than 8 h and duty
    cycles greater than 8 h. A process to demonstrate qualifications for both applications
    is provided in this standard.'
