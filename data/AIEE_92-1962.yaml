abstract:
- content: 'Nomenclature for alternating-current system voltage should include designations
    for nominal system voltages and, associated with each nominal voltage: (1) an
    identification of the minimum and maximum acceptable limits for the system operating
    voltage under favorable and tolerable conditions, and (2) an identification by
    voltage rating of devices and equipment to be applied on each system.The AIEE
    Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Committee has documented preferred system
    voltage nomenclature for industrial plant and commercial building power systems
    in Tables 1(A), 1(B), and II. It is intended that this information be useful to
    plant engineers, power-system engineers, application engineers, consulting engineers,
    electrical contractors, and equipment manufacturers in understanding current system
    voltage nomenclature. In addition, a comparison is made to current electric utility
    power-system practice. This report represents the unanimous agreement of the Working
    Group with the approval of the Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Committee.
    Every attempt was made to incorporate preferred practice as well as to include
    existing practice in industrial and commercial use, recognizing also electrical
    utility use. It is the objective that the preferred practices in this report be
    followed, and that due consideration be given in any Standards revision.'
