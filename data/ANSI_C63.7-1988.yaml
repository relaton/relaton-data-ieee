abstract:
- content: Provides information that is useful in the construction of an open area
    test site (OATS) used to perform radiated emission measurements in the frequency
    range 30-1000 MHz. The key recommendations for site selection, ground plane, instrumentation
    and equipment under test (EUT) services, and all-weather covers are described.<<ETX>>
