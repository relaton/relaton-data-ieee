abstract:
- content: A protection profile for hardcopy devices in a small, private information
    processing environment is discussed in this standard in which most elements of
    security are provided by the physical environment, but basic network security
    is needed to protect the device and its network from misuse from outside of the
    environment. Small offices and home offices are typical applications of this environment.
    This environment will be known as "operational environment D".
