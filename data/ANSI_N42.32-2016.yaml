abstract:
- content: Minimum performance specifications and testing methods for the evaluation
    of alarming personal radiation detectors, also known as PRDs, are contained in
    this standard. These detectors are pocket-sized and carried on the body. These
    instruments are primarily designed for the detection and location of radioactive
    materials emitting gamma rays, and possibly neutrons, and not intended to function
    as electronic dosimeters. The specifications for general, radiological, environmental,
    electromagnetic, and mechanical performance are given, and the corresponding testing
    methods are described. The documentation to be provided by the manufacturer is
    listed as part of the requirements. A number of informative annexes that provide
    useful information and guidance in implementing this standard are also contained
    in this standard.
