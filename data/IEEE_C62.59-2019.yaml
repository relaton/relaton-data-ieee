abstract:
- content: Supersedes IEEE C62.35-2010 and IEEE C62.35-2010/Cor1-2018. The basic electrical
    parameters to be met by silicon PN junction voltage clamping components used for
    the protection of telecommunications equipment or lines from surges are defined
    in this standard. It is intended that this standard be used for the harmonization
    of existing or future specifications issued by PN diode surge protective component
    manufacturers, telecommunication equipment manufacturers, administrations, or
    network operators.
