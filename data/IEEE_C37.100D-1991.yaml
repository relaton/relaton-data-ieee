abstract:
- content: Supplement to IEEE C37.100-1981. Add definition "Initial Transient Recovery
    Voltage". Terms that encompass the products with the scope of the C37 project
    are defined. These include power switchgear for switching, interrupting, metering,
    protection, and regulating purposes as used primarily in connection with generation,
    transmission, distribution, and conversion of electric power. The definitions
    do not purport to embrace other meanings that the terms may properly have when
    used in connection with other subjects.
