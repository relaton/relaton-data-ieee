abstract:
- content: This performance standard covers absorptive and reflective attenuators,
    both fixed as well as continuously variable or variable in fixed steps, both manual
    and programmable types. It does not cover electronic or solid state-type attenuators.
    This standard permits the user to select for a specification those minimum performance
    parameters which characterize an attenuator. A list of preferred test methods
    is included permitting verification of the attenuation characteristics. Practical
    minimum performance limits are furnished for various applications. These are for
    guidance only and will improve with time.
