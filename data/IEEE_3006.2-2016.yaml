abstract:
- content: Described in this recommended practice are criteria for evaluating the
    reliability of existing industrial and commercial power systems. It is likely
    to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience
    in the area of reliability. It can also be an aid to all engineers responsible
    for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.
