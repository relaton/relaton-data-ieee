abstract:
- content: Guidance for users and manufacturers in the determination of (1) the Allowable
    Continuous Current Class (ACCC) designations, (2) the continuous load current-carrying
    capabilities of air switches under various conditions of ambient temperature,
    and (3) the emergency load current-carrying capabilities of air switches under
    various conditions of ambient temperature is provided. This guide applies to ac
    high-voltage air switches in excess of 1000 V
