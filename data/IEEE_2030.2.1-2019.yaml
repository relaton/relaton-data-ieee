abstract:
- content: 'Application of this standard includes: (1) Stationary battery energy storage
    system (BESS) and mobile BESS; (2) Carrier of BESS, including but not limited
    to lead acid battery, lithiumion battery, flow battery, and sodium-sulfur battery;
    (3) BESS used in electric power systems (EPS). Also provided in this standard
    are alternatives for connection (including DR interconnection), design, operation,
    and maintenance of stationary or mobile BESS used in EPS. Introduction, overview,
    and engineering issues related to the BESS are given.'
