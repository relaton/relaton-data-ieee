abstract:
- content: Guidelines for establishing criteria for application, performance, interchangeability,
    tests, life cycle costs, and safety requirements of traction power rectifier transformers
    are established in this standard. Set forth are the electrical, mechanical and
    theremal design, manufacturing, and testing requirements for traction power rectifier
    transformers for dc electrification systems. Covered in this standard are liquid-immersed
    and dry-type transformers, including those with cast coil and epoxy resin encapsulated
    windings.
