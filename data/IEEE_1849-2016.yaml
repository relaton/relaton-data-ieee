abstract:
- content: A grammar for a tag-based language whose aim is to provide designers of
    information systems with a unified and extensible methodology for capturing systems
    behaviors by means of event logs and event streams is defined in the XES standard.
    An XML Schema describing the structure of an XES event log/stream and a XML Schema
    describing the structure of an extension of such a log/stream are included in
    this standard. Moreover, a basic collection of so-called XES extension prototypes
    that provide semantics to certain attributes as recorded in the event log/stream
    is included in this standard.
