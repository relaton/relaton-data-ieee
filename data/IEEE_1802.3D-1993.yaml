abstract:
- content: Methods for conformance testing to satisfy requirements arising from the
    ISO/IEC 8802-3 [ANSI/IEEE Std 802.3] standard are defined. The conformance test
    suite is intended to detect incorrect implementations of the ISO/IEC 8802-3 standard,
    clause 14. It comprises two categories of test groups. The first category relates
    to basic interconnection testing and the second to capability and behavior testing.
    The test setups, adapters, and instruments used are described.
