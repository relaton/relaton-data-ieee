abstract:
- content: Recommendations to protect personnel in military environments against established
    adverse health effects associated with exposure to electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic
    fields, induced and contact current, and contact and arcing voltages over the
    frequency range of 0 Hz to 300 GHz are provided in this standard. IEEE Std C95.1-2345(TM)
    was developed to replace NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization
    Agreement (STANAG) 2345 (Edition 3), Evaluation and Control of Personnel Exposure
    to Radio Frequency Fields3 kHz to 300 GHz, (13 February 2003).
