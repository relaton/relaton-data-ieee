abstract:
- content: This standard provides the means to define and describe signals used in
    testing. It also provides a set of common basic signals, built upon formal mathematical
    specifications so that signals can be combined to form complex signals usable
    across all test platforms. This standard contains additional downloads at http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/1641/1641-2010
