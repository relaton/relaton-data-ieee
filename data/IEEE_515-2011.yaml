- content: Specific testing requirements for qualifying electrical resistance heating
    cables and heating devices for use in industrial applications, as well as a basis
    for electrical and thermal design, are included in this standard. Unclassified
    applications and explosive atmosphere applications that use both Divisions and
    Zone methods of classification are included.
