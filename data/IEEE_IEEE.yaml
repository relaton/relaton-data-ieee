abstract:
- content: This standard adopts IEC 61000-4-15:2010, which gives a functional and
    design specification for flicker measuring apparatus intended to indicate the
    correct flicker perception level for all practical voltage fluctuation waveforms.
    Information is presented to enable such an instrument to be constructed. A method
    is given for the evaluation of flicker severity on the basis of the output of
    flickermeters complying with this standard. The object of IEC 61000-4-15:2010
    is to provide basic information for the design and the instrumentation of an analogue
    or digital flicker measuring apparatus. It does not give tolerance limit values
    of flicker severity.
