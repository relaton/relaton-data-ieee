abstract:
- content: This guide provides guidance and recommended practices on the installation
    and maintenance of liquid-immersed power transformers rated 501 kVA and above
    with secondary voltages of 1000 V and above. This guide covers the entire range
    of power transformers, including extra high voltage (EHV) transformers. This guide
    does not cover special transformers such as furnace transformers, rectifier transformers
    etc. Distinctions are made as required for various MVA ratings, voltage ratings,
    and types of liquid insulation.
