abstract:
- content: Activities related to motor-starting studies, including design considerations
    for new systems, analytical studies for existing systems, as well as operational
    and model-validation considerations for industrial and commercial power systems
    are described. Motor-starting analysis includes evaluation of motor-starting current
    and voltage drop. Accuracy of calculation results primarily relies on system modeling
    assumptions and methods used. The use of computer-aided analysis software, with
    a list of desirable capabilities recommended to conduct a modern motor-starting
    study, is emphasized. Examples of system data requirements and result-analysis
    techniques are presented. Benefits obtained from motor-starting studies are discussed,
    and various types of computer-aided motor-starting studies are examined. Data
    or information required for these studies, as well as the expected results of
    a motor-starting study effort, are also reviewed.
