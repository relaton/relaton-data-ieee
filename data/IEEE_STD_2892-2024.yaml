abstract:
- content: The functional, performance, and test requirements for 1.5kV to 35kV medium-voltage
    dc transformers are specified and the definitions, topology and configuration,
    primary equipment, control and protection requirements, interface specifications,
    auxiliary system requirements, and application scenarios for medium-voltage dc
    transformers in distribution systems are covered in this recommended practice.
