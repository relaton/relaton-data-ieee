abstract:
- content: An ECMAScript application programming interface (API) for content-to-runtime-services
    communication is described in this standard. It is based on a current industry
    practice called &#x201C;CMI-computer managed instruction.&#x201D; This API enables
    the communication of information between content and a runtime service (RTS) typically
    provided by a learning management system (LMS) via common API services using the
    ECMAScript language. The purpose of this standard is to build consensus around,
    resolve ambiguities, and correct defects in existing specifications for an ECMA&#x00AC;Script
    API for exchanging data between learning-related content and an LMS.
