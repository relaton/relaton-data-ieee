abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed September 2007. Methods for measuring the inherent vibration
    damping characteristics of overhead conductors are presented. The intent is to
    obtain information in a compatible and consistent form that will provide a reliable
    basis for studying the vibration and damping of conductors in the future, and
    for comparing data of various investigators. The methods and procedures recommended
    are not intended for quality-control test purposes.
