abstract:
- content: This standard provides definitions and explanations of key concepts in
    the fields of spectrum management, cognitive radio, policy-defined radio, adaptive
    radio, software-defined radio, and related technologies. The document goes beyond
    simple, short definitions by providing amplifying text that explains these terms
    in the context of the technologies that use them. The document also describes
    how these technologies interrelate and create new capabilities while at the same
    time providing mechanisms supportive of new spectrum management paradigms such
    as dynamic spectrum access.
