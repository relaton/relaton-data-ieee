abstract:
- content: This guide presents an overview of the existing and emerging temperature
    monitoring systems related to power cable installations. It summarizes the features,
    benefits and limitations of both discrete and distributed temperature monitoring
    for cable ratings. This guide also addresses the various aspects of user-interface
    and data communication issues needed to make the system more effective and more
    user-friendly.
