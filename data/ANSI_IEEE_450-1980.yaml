abstract:
- content: Large stationary lead storage batteries play an ever increasing role in
    substation and generating station control and power systems and in providing the
    back-up energy for emergencies. This recommended practice fulfills the need within
    the industry to provide common or standard practices of maintenance, testing,
    and replacement. The methods described are applicable to all installations and
    battery sizes. The installations considered herein are designed for full-float
    operation with a battery charger serving to maintain the battery in a charged
    condition as well as to supply the normal dc load.
