abstract:
- content: This recommended practice is limited to providing recommended practices
    of maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures that can be used to optimize
    the life and performance of large lead storage batteries. It also provides guidance
    to determine when batteries should be replaced. There are other test procedures
    and replacement techniques used within the industry (especially for smaller substation
    batteries) which are equally as effective but are beyond the scope of this recommended
    practice. Sizing, installation, qualification, other battery types, and application
    are also beyond the scope of this recommended practice. This recommended practice
    does not include any other component of the dc system nor surveillance and testing
    of the dc system, even though the battery is part of that system. Preoperational
    and periodic dc system tests of chargers and other dc components may require that
    the battery be connected to the system. Details for these tests will depend on
    the requirements of the dc system and are not within the scope of this recommended
    practice.
