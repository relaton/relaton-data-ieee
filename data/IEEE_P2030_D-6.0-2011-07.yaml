abstract:
- content: This document provides guidelines for smart grid interoperability. This
    guide provides a knowledge base addressing terminology, characteristics, functional
    performance and evaluation criteria, and the application of engineering principles
    for smart grid interoperability of the electric power system with end use applications
    and loads. The guide discusses alternate approaches to good practices for the
    smart grid.
