abstract:
- content: Superseded; included in C95.3-1991. Techniques and instrumentation for
    the measurement of potentially hazardous electromagnetic fields are specified.
    The recommendations apply to hazards to personnel. However, the measurement techniques
    and instruments described are also applicable to the measurement of fields in
    the neighborhood of flammable materials and explosive devices, even though exposure
    standards for these situations have not been established.
