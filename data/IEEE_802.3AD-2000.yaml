    An optional Link Aggregation sublayer for use with CSMA/CD MACs is defined. Link
    Aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a Link
    Aggregation Group, such that a MAC Client can treat the Link Aggregation Group
    as if it were a single link. To this end, it specifies the establishment of DTE
    to DTE logical links, consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point
    links operating at the same data rate.
