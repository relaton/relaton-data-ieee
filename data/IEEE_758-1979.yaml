abstract:
- content: A set of standard subroutines that provide access to CAMAC facilities in
    a variety of computer programming languages is described. The subroutines are
    specifically intended to be suitable for use with FORTRAN, although they are not
    restricted to that language. The subroutines have been grouped into three subsets
    in order to provide different standard levels of implementation. The lowest level
    requires only two subroutines, but, nevertheless, gives access to most of the
    facilities that can be found in CAMAC. In higher levels of implementation, subroutines
    are added that permit procedures to be written in more mnemonic terminology, provide
    better handling of LAMs, permit procedures to be independent of the type of CAMAC
    highway used, and provide efficient block-transfer capability.
