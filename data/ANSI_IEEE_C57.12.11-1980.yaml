abstract:
- content: New, large, oil-immersed power transformers with high-voltage windings
    rated 69--287 kV inclusive are primarily considered. Inspection on receipt, internal
    inspection, handling, assembly of fittings, vacuum treatment, filling with oil,
    tests, and field drying are covered. Appropriate sections of the guide may be
    applied to lower-voltage transformers when similar conditions and similar transformer
    construction exist, and may also be used in servicing older transformers that
    have been opened for maintenance or repair work.
