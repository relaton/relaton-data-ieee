abstract:
- content: 'Definitions of MAC related functions to enable spectrum resource management
    are addressed in this amendment to IEEE Std 802.15.4&#x2122;. It specifies the
    following: - Spectrum resource measurements and network performance metrics, such
    as packet error ratio, delay, etc. - Information elements and data structures
    to capture these measurements, - Procedures for collecting and exchanging spectrum
    resource measurement information with higher layers or otherre devices. The PDF
    of this standard is available at no cost to you compliments of the IEEE GET program.
    Visit https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page for more details.'
