abstract:
- content: Superseded by C57.12.90-1987. Methods for performing tests specified in
    IEEE Std C57.12.00-1993, IEEE Standard General Requirements for Liquid-Immersed
    Distribution, Power, and Regulating Transformers, and other standards applicable
    to liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers are described.
    Instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators, arc furnace
    transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding transformers,
    and mine transformers are excluded. This standard covers resistance measurement,
    polarity and phase-relation tests, ratio tests, no-load-loss and excitation current
    measurements, impedance and loadloss measurements, dielectric tests, temperature
    tests, short-circuit tests, and audible-sound-level measurements.
