abstract:
- content: This recommended practice defines techno-economic terminologies used in
    the construction and operation of low carbon power generator and energy storage
    systems. There is no consistent definition of techno-economic terminologies that
    have arisen in the evolution of low carbon power generator and electrical energy
    storage technologies. The terminologies will support stakeholders in using a common
    language when planning standards and for understanding published industrial and
    technical reports.
