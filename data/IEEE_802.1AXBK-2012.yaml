abstract:
- content: Link Aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to
    form a Link Aggregation Group, such that a Media Access Control (MAC) Client can
    treat the Link Aggregation Group as if it were a single link. To this end, it
    specifies the establishment of data terminal equipment (DTE) to DTE logical links,
    consisting of N parallel instances of full-duplex, point-to-point links operating
    at the same data rate. The MAC independent Link Aggregation capability, and general
    information relevant to specific MAC types that support Link Aggregation, are
    defined in this standard.
