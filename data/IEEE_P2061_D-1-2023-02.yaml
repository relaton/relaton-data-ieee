abstract:
- content: Architecture for a low mobility and energy-efficient network for affordable
    broadband access is specified in this standard. This network is referred to as
    the Frugal 5G network. The network comprises of a wireless middle-mile network,
    an access network, and the associated control and management functions. The major
    interfaces in the Frugal 5G network are also specified.
