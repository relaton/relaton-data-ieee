abstract:
- content: Definite-purpose switching devices for use in metal-enclosed, low-voltage,
    power circuit breaker switchgear described in IEEE Std C37.20.1(TM) are covered
    in this standard. The switching devices shall be fused, drawout type, three-pole
    construction, with one or more rated maximum ac voltages of 600 V, 508 V, and
    254 V for application on systems having nominal ac voltages of 600 V, 480 V, and
    240 V. The switching devices are power operated with integral or separately mounted
    overcurrent protective devices. Service conditions, ratings, functional components,
    temperature limitations and classifications of insulating materials, insulation
    (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application
    are addressed in this standard. The switching devices are normally used in motor
    control or other repetitive duty applications that require frequency of operation
    greater than normal operations expected of low-voltage power circuit breakers.
