abstract:
- content: The testability structure for digital circuits described in IEEE Std 1149.1&#8482;
    has been extended to provide similar facilities for mixed-signal circuits. The
    architecture is described, together with the means of control of and access to,
    both analog and digital test data. Sample implementation and application details
    (which are not part of the standard) are included for illustration. Also, extensions
    to the standard Boundary-Scan Description Language (BSDL) are defined that allow
    description of key component-specific aspects of such testability features.
