abstract:
- content: Electrical, mechanical, and safety requirements of ventilated, nonventilated,
    and sealed dry-type distribution and power transformers or autotransformers, single
    and polyphase, with a voltage of 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding,
    are described. Information that can be used as a basis for the establishment of
    performance, interchangeability, and safety requirements of equipment described,
    and for assistance in the proper selection of such equipment, is given.
