abstract:
- content: Maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures that can be used to
    optimize the life and performance of permanently installed, vented lead-acid storage
    batteries used for standby service are provided. This recommended practice also
    provides guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced. This recommended
    practice is applicable to standby service stationary applications where a charger
    maintains the battery fully charged and supplies the dc loads.
