abstract:
- content: This standard is intended to promote and facilitate interoperability between
    components of automatic test systems. The standard facilitates the capture of
    maintenance action information associated with the removal, repair, and replacement
    of a particular system components (e.g.; unit(s) under test) in order to maintain/support
    that particular operational system. The maintenance action information schema
    becomes a class of information that can be used within the SIMICA family of standards.
    The exchange format utilizes the XML formats.
