abstract:
- content: 'A new wave of artificial intelligence applications that offer extensive
    benefits to our daily lives has been led to by dramatic success in machine learning.
    The loss of explainability during this transition, however, means vulnerability
    to vicious data, poor model structure design, and suspicion of stakeholders and
    the general public--all with a range of legal implications. The study of explainable
    AI (XAI), which is an active research field that aims to make AI systems results
    more understandable to humans, has been called for by this dilemma. This is a
    field with great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems
    and is considered a necessary route for AI to move forward. A technological blueprint
    for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, while meeting the
    requirements of transparent and trustworthy AI by adopting a variety of XAI methodologies,
    is provided by this guide. It defines the architectural framework and application
    guidelines for explainable AI, including: description and definition of XAI; the
    types of XAI methods and the application scenarios to which each type applies;
    and performance evaluation of XAI.'
