abstract:
- content: This application guide applies to AC high-voltage circuit breakers rated
    in accordance with the methods given in American National Standard Rating Structure
    for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.04-1964 (R 1969) and listed in American
    National Standard Preferred Ratings and Related Required Capabilities for AC High-Voltage
    Circuit Breakers, C37.06-1971. Circuit breakers rated and manufactured to meet
    other standards, or used in switchgear assemblies, should be applied in accordance
    with application procedures adapted to their specific ratings or applications.
