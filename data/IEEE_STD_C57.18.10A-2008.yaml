abstract:
- content: Amendment to IEEE Std C57.18.10-1998. This standard practice provides rating
    data, construction requirements, testing, and calculation methods for dry-type
    or liquid-filled semiconductor power rectifier transformers. These transformers
    supply nonsinusoidal load currents and are subject to higher harmonic load losses
    than standard power transformers. A number of examples illustrating harmonic loss
    calculations are presented in a reference annex.
