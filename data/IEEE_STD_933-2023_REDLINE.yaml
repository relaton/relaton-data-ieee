abstract:
- content: Guidelines for the definition of a reliability program at nuclear power
    generating stations and other nuclear facilities are provided. The document emphasizes
    reliability programs during the operating phase of such stations; however, the
    general approach applies to all phases of the nuclear power generating station
    life cycle (e.g., design, construction, start-up, operating, and decommissioning).
