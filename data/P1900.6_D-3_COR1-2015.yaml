abstract:
- content: Terms and definitions are modified in this corrigendum to IEEE Std 1900.6(TM)-2011,
    in response to comments received during the approval process of IEEE Std 1900.1a(TM)-2012
    and IEEE Std 1900.6a(TM)-2014, which could not be considered in the 1900.6a amendment.
    The use of terms and definitions in IEEE Std 1900.6 are aligned by these corrections,
    with their use in the scope of IEEE Std 1900.1.
