abstract:
- content: This standard defines an object model with a network-neutral interface
    for connecting processors to communication networks, sensors, and actuators. The
    object model containing blocks, services, and components specifies interactions
    with sensors and actuators and forms the basis for implementing application code
    executing in the processor.
