abstract:
- content: The interdisciplinary tasks, which are required throughout a system's life
    cycle to transform customer needs, requirements, and constraints into a system
    solution, are defined. In addition, the requirements for the systems engineering
    process and its application throughout the product life cycle are specified. The
    focus of this standard is on engineering activities necessary to guide product
    development while ensuring that the product is properly designed to make it affordable
    to produce, own, operate, maintain, and eventually to dispose of, without undue
    risk to health or the environment.
