abstract:
- content: 'This standard applies to all single or multi-pole alternating-current
    automatic circuit reclosers and automatic line sectionalizers for the nominal
    voltages from 1,500 to 23,000 volts. In order to simplify this standard where
    possible: The term "recloser" has been substituted for "automatic circuit recloser."
    The term "sectionalizer" has been substituted for "automatic line sectionalizer".'
