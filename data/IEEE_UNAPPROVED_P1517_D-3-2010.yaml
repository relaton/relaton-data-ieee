abstract:
- content: A common framework for extending the system and software life cycle processes
    of IEEE Std 12207-2008 to include the systematic practice of reuse is provided.
    This standard specifies the processes, activities, and tasks to be applied during
    each life cycle process to enable a system and/or product to be constructed from
    reusable assets. It also specifies the processes, activities, and tasks to enable
    the identification, construction, maintenance, and management of assets supplied.
