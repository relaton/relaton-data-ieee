abstract:
- content: Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) survey
    technology has been widely used in the survey and design of overhead transmission
    line projects, benefiting from its high precision and efficiency, especially for
    high-voltage overhead transmission lines in complex terrain areas. The technical
    requirements for various production stages, including the composition of UAS LiDAR
    systems, flight design and implementation, data processing, 3D (three-dimensional)
    digital surveying and mapping, field investigation and survey, and 3D digital
    design, are specified in this standard. The aim is to standardize the operation
    process of UAS LiDAR survey and meet the requirements of survey and design for
    overhead transmission line projects with a voltage level above 110kV. This standard
    is applicable to guide the survey of the light and small civilian UAS LiDAR in
    the survey and design of new and reconstructed overhead transmission line projects,
    and as a reference for the construction, operation, and maintenance.
