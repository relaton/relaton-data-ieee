abstract:
- content: The scope of this document is the development of a common receiver/fixture
    interface (RFI) specification that is based upon available commercial standards
    integrated under a common "open" architecture. This mechanical/electrical interface
    is intended to serve government/commercial interest for applications in test,
    system integration, manufacturing, monitoring, and other functional requirements
    that demand large contact densities and quick-disconnect mechanical operation.
