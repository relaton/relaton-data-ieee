abstract:
- content: 'This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2018 extends the operation of Ethernet
    passive optical networks (EPONs) to multiple channels of 25 Gb/s providing both
    symmetric and asymmetric operation for the following data rates downstream/upstream):
    25/10 Gb/s, 25/25 Gb/s, 50/10 Gb/s, 50/25 Gb/s, and 50/50 Gb/s. This standard
    specifies the 25 Gb/s EPON Multi-Channel Reconciliation Sublayer (MCRS), Nx25G-EPON
    Physical Coding Sublayers (PCSs), Physical Media Attachment (PMA) sublayers, and
    Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayers that support both symmetric and asymmetric
    data rates while maintaining backward compatibility with already deployed 10 Gb/s
    EPON equipment. Backward compatibility with deployed 1G-EPON and ITU-T G.984 GPON
    is maintained with 25GBASE-PQ for the specific case of 1G-EPON and GPON ONUs using
    reduced-band (40 nm) lasers. The EPON operation is defined for distances of at
    least 20 km, and for a split ratio of at least 1:32.'
