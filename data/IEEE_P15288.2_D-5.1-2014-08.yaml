abstract:
- content: This standard establishes the requirements for technical reviews and audits
    to be performed throughout the acquisition lifecycle for the U.S. Department of
    Defense (DoD) and other defense agencies. This standard provides the definition,
    description, and intent, as well as the entry/exit/success criteria, for each
    technical review and audit. It is to be used to establish agreement between acquirers
    and suppliers on the technical reviews and audits that are needed for the project,
    as well as the focus and expectations of each.
