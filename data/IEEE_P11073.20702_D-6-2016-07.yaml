abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care
    (POC) 1 medical device communication (MDC), this standard defines a communication
    protocol specification for a distributed system of point-of-care (PoC) medical
    devices and medical IT systems that need to exchange data or safely control networked
    PoC medical devices by profiling Web service specifications and defining additional
    Web service specifications as part of this standard
