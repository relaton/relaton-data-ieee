abstract:
- content: 'This document complements the architecture-related processes identified
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42020, ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and ISO 15704 with
    a framework in support of architecture evaluation. It especially supports the
    Architecture Evaluation process in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42020. Implementing the principles
    and concepts in this framework will help ensure that the architecture has greater
    influence on business and mission success. It specifies a coherent set of elements
    for use in evaluation synthesis, value assessment and architectural analysis.
    Users of this standard can apply the framework in the context of: (1) determination
    of the suitability of a proposed architecture; (2) choosing among architecture
    alternatives; and (3) assessing the mission or business impact from the use of
    a new architecture or change to an established architecture.'
