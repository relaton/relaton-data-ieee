abstract:
- content: 'This document provides guidance for organizations in the application of
    ISO 9001:2015 to the acquisition, supply, development, operation and maintenance
    of computer software and related support services. This document does not add
    to or otherwise change the requirements of ISO 9001:2015. The guidelines provided
    in this document are not intended to be used as assessment criteria in quality
    management system registration/certification. The application of this document
    is appropriate to software that is: part of a commercial contract with another
    organization, a product available for a market sector, used to support the processes
    of an organization, embedded in a hardware product, or related to software services.
    Some organizations may be involved in all the above activities; others may specialize
    in one area. Whatever the situation, the organization''s quality management system
    should cover all aspects (software related and non-software related) of the business.
    This document identifies the issues that should be addressed and is independent
    of the technology, life cycle models, development processes, sequence of activities
    and organizational structure used by an organization. Additional guidance and
    frequent references to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 software engineering standards are
    provided to assist in the application of ISO 9001:2015, in particular ISO/IEC/
    IEEE 12207:2017.'
