abstract:
- content: Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are gradually becoming common tools for
    power grid inspections. With the increasing use of UAS, intelligent hangars have
    emerged. The requirements for the hangar architecture, functionality, performance
    characteristics, environmental monitoring and management, and storage for grid
    inspection Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are specified in this standard. Requirements
    for batteries used in UAS, and information management systems for UAS hangar operations
    are also defined.
