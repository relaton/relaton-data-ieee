abstract:
- content: Meshed tree bridging protocol (MTBP) ensures that bridged network constituents
    receive high reliability in frame delivery in the event of link or bridge failures.
    MTBP is based on the meshed tree algorithm (MTA) that allows for simultaneous
    construction and maintenance of multiple trees or tree branches from a single
    root. In the event of tree branch failures due to link or bridge failures, another
    preconstructed and maintained branch exists as an immediate fallback. Recovery
    and tree pruning times in meshed tree bridging is minimal. Multiple roots should
    be preassigned to construct multiple distinguishable meshed trees from each root.
    In the event of a root bridge failure, the standby root and its meshed tree provides
    loop-free paths for frame forwarding with minimal recovery delays.
