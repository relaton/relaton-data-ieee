abstract:
- content: Augmented Reality (AR) promises to provide significant boosts in operational
    efficiency by making information available to employees needing task support in
    context in real time. To support according implementations of AR training systems,this
    document proposes an overarching integrated conceptual model that describes interactions
    between the physical world, the user, and digital information, the context for
    AR-assisted learning and other parameters of the environment. It defines two data
    models and their binding to XML and JSON for representing learning activities
    (also known as employee tasks and procedures) and the learning environment in
    which these tasks are performed (also known as the workplace). The interoperability
    specification and standard is presented in support of an open market where interchangeable
    component products provide alternatives to monolithic Augmented Reality-assisted
    learning systems. Moreover, it facilitates the creation of experience repositories
    and online marketplaces for Augmented Reality-enabled learning content. Specific
    attention was given to reuse and repurposing of existing learning content and
    catering to ‘mixed’ experiences combining real world learner guidance with the
    consumption (or production) of traditional contents such as instructional video
    material or learning apps and widgets.
