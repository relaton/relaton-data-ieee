abstract:
- content: The reference model presented in this standard provides a common interpretation
    basis by which tools can express and communicate the observable features of system/software
    behavior to users and to other tools. This standard specifies a conceptual metamodel
    for understanding and describing the causal behavior for a system. The purpose
    of this conceptual metamodel is to express causal behavior and compositions of
    causal behavior in a model which integrates all observable perational features
    of a system into one behavior specification. This conceptual metamodel is useful
    for analyzing systems, for constructing particular system behavior models, and
    for using those models in the specification, design, and evaluation of engineered
    systems. It provides the necessary semantic elements for describing general hardware/software
    systems, including hardware-only, software-only, or mixed system components, and
    it allows these different types of components to be treated in a consistent manner,
    providing a basis for representing a wide variety of systems.
