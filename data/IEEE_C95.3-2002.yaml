abstract:
- content: echniques and instrumentation for the measurement and computation of potentially
    hazardous electromagnetic (EM) fields both in the near field and the far field
    of the electromagnetic source are specified.The specifications previously set
    forth in IEEE Std C95.3 -1991 are extended and combined. Leakage and near-field
    measurements and a description of the concepts, techniques, and instruments that
    can be applied to the measurement of specific absorption rate (SAR) or the electric
    field strength in organisms (including humans) and phantoms exposed to electromagnetic
    fields are included.Below 100 MHz, the current flowing through the body to ground
    is measurable and can be used to determine the SAR and, therefore, a brief treatment
    of low- frequency body current measurement is included. The "IEEE Get Program"
    grants public access to view and download individual PDFs of select standards
    at no charge. Visit http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/index.html for details.
