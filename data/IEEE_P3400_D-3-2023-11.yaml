abstract:
- content: This standard provides requirements and recommendations for technical terminology
    and communications in the English language that are more inclusive. These requirements
    apply to technical information in communications, such as standards, policies,
    plans, procedures, reports, specifications; machine-readable languages, and other
    forms of human-readable technical communications. This standard includes requirements
    for the processes of identifying and replacing non-inclusive and deprecated terminology.
    This standard identifies deprecated terms and acceptable replacement terms.
