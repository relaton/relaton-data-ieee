abstract:
- content: A method is provided for specifying a common interoperable format for electronic
    systems design. The format provides a common way to specify information/data about
    the project management, netlists, components, design rules, and geometries used
    in LSI-Package-Board designs. The method provides the ability for electronic systems
    as a key consideration early in the design process, the design tools can use to
    exchange information/data seamlessly.
