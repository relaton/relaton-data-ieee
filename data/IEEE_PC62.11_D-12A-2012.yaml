abstract:
- content: This standard applies to metal-oxide surge arresters (MOSAs) designed to
    repeatedly limit the voltage surges on 48 Hz to 62 Hz power circuits (&#x003E;
    1000 V) by passing surge discharge current and automatically limiting the flow
    of system power current. This standard applies to devices for separate mounting
    and to devices supplied integrally with other equipment. The tests demonstrate
    that an arrester is able to survive the rigors of reasonable environmental conditions
    and system phenomena while protecting equipment and/or the system from damaging
    overvoltages caused by lightning, switching, and other undesirable surges.
