abstract:
- content: This Guide addresses the application of transformers in the presence of
    oscillatory switching transients. These oscillatory transients are typically produced
    by the interaction of the switching device, transformer, load, and system. This
    Guide defines operating conditions that may produce switching voltages damaging
    to the transformer insulation system. It discusses the electrical characteristics
    of the system source, switching device, transformer, and load and the nature of
    their transient interaction. It outlines several mitigation methods. Two examples
    are included.
