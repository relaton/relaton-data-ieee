abstract:
- content: Specifications are given for carbon 14, tritium, and background check sources
    in toluene-based scintillators. Use of these materials is sufficient to verify
    the stability of counting efficiency and background of liquid- scintillation counting
    systems as outlined in ANSI N42.15-1980. This standard specifies the solvent,
    the organic scintillator solutes, the purging gas, the radioactive material, and
    the container appropriate for preparation of check sources.
