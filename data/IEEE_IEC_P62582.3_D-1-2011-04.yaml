abstract:
- content: This International Standard contains methods for condition monitoring of
    organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using tensile
    elongation techniques in the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible
    measurements. It includes the requirements for selection of samples, the measurement
    system and conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results. Standards
    in the IEC/IEEE 62582-series are measurement standards, primarily for use in the
    management of ageing in initial qualification and after installation. IEC/IEEE
    62582-1 General includes requirements for the application of the IEC/IEEE 62582
    series and some elements which are common to all methods. Information on the role
    of condition monitoring in qualification of equipment important to safety is found
    in IEEE Std 323. This standard is intended for application to non-energised equipment.
