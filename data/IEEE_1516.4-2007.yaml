abstract:
- content: This recommended practice defines the processes and procedures that should
    be followed to implement Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) for
    federations being developed using the High Level Architecture (HLA) Federation
    Development and Execution Process (FEDEP). This recommended practice is not intended
    to replace existing VV&A policies, procedures and guidance, but rather is intended
    to focus on the unique aspects of VV&A of federations. It is a higher-level framework
    into which such practices can be integrated and tailored for specific uses. The
    VV&A Overlay provides implementation-level guidance to VV&A practitioners.
