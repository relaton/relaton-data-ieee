abstract:
- content: Recommendations are given for reactors intended for series connection,
    in both transmission and distribution systems, to control power flow under steady-state
    conditions and/or limit fault current under short-circuit conditions. Dry-Type
    air-core reactors covered by this standard are self-cooled by natural air convection.
    With some restrictions, other reactors, including filter reactors, shunt capacitor
    reactors (used with shunt capacitor banks), and discharge current limiting reactors
    (used with series capacitor banks), are also covered.
