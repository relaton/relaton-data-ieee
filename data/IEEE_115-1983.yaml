abstract:
- content: Instructions for conducting the more generally applicable and accepted
    tests to determine the performance characteristics of synchronous machines are
    contained in this guide. Although the tests described are applicable in general
    to synchronous generators, synchronous motors (larger than fractional horsepower),
    synchronous condensers, and synchronous frequency changers, the descriptions make
    reference primarily to synchronous generators and synchronous motors.
