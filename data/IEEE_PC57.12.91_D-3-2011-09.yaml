abstract:
- content: This revision addresses substantive changes to Clause 5, 10 and 11 of existing
    C57.12.91-2001 to reflect current practice in the testing procedures of dry-type
    transformers. This revision does not address transformer requirements and specific
    test criteria; rather they are contained in appropriate standards such as IEEE
    Std C57.12.01-2005 or in user specifications.
