abstract:
- content: This standard defines synchronized phasor measurements used in power system
    applications. It provides a method to quantify the measurement, tests to be sure
    the measurement conforms to the definition, and error limits for the test. It
    also defines a data communication protocol including message formats for communicating
    this data in a real-time system. Explanation, examples, and supporting information
    are also provided.
