abstract:
- content: Terms and definitions relating to inertial sensors are presented in this
    standard. Usage as understood by the inertial sensor community is given preference
    over general technical usage of the terms herein. The criterion for inclusion
    of a term and its definition in this standard is usefulness as related to inertial
    sensor technology.
