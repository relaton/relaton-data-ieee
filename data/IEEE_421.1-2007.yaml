abstract:
- content: This standard defines elements and commonly used components in excitation
    systems and contains definitions for excitation systems applied to synchronous
    machines. An included annex contains one-line block diagrams of some typical excitation
    systems. These are presented to illustrate the defined terminology referenced
    in this standard and clarify the understanding of the excitation control system.
