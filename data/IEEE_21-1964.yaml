abstract:
- content: 'This standard covers the following: electrical requirements for outdoor
    power apparatus bushings having basic impulse insulation levels 110 through 1300
    kilovolts. Mechanical requirements for the outdoor power apparatus bushings; dimensions
    of the outdoor power transformer and alternating-current power circuit breaker
    apparatus bushings. This standard does not apply to bushings for indoor apparatus,
    dry type instrument transformers, air-blast transformers, dry type regulators,
    oil-less and oil-poor apparatus, roof, floor, wall and generator bushings, potheads,
    distribution type circuit breakers and back-connected switch insulators. Bushing
    requirements as set forth in this standard apply to bushings when mounted for
    testing, according to requirements outlined in the paper.'
