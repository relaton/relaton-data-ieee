abstract:
- content: Information concerning system voltage nomenclature and the preferred voltage
    ratings of distribution apparatus and utilization equipment are contained in this
    recommended practice. This is essential to proper voltage identification throughout
    a power distribution system. The dynamic characteristics of the system and the
    proper principles of voltage control applied so that satisfactory voltages will
    be supplied to utilization equipment under operating conditions are discussed.
    An understanding of system voltage nomenclature and the preferred voltage ratings
    of distribution apparatus and utilization equipment is essential to help ensure
    proper voltage identification throughout a power distribution system. The dynamic
    characteristics of the system need to be recognized, and the proper principles
    of voltage control applied so that satisfactory voltages will be supplied to all
    utilization equipment under all normal conditions of operation.
