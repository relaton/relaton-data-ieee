abstract:
- content: This standard covers the Protection Profile for Hardcopy Devices in a small,
    private information processing environment in which most elements of security
    are provided by the physical environment, but basic network security is needed
    to protect the device and its network from misuse from outside of the environment.
    Small offices and home offices are typical applications of this environment. This
    environment will be known as "Operational Environment D."
