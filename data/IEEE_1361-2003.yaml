abstract:
- content: This guide is applicable to all stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems where
    PV is the only charging source. Stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system parameters
    and operating conditions are discussed in relation to battery characteristics
    and expected system performance. Charging parameters for PV systems are suggested
    to help in the selection of a battery for a specific application. Finally, a performance
    test to verify the battery selection and system parameters is provided, including
    discussions on how to interpret test results. Test results only provide information
    on initial battery performance. No cycle-life predictions are made.
