abstract:
- content: This standard describes the EME2-AES and XCB-AES wide block encryption
    with associated data (EAD) modes of the NIST AES block cipher, providing usage
    guidelines and test vectors. A wide block encryption algorithm is one in which
    behaves as a single block cipher with a large plaintext input and ciphertext output,
    but uses a narrow block cipher (in this case AES) internally. These encryption
    modes are oriented towards random access storage devices that do not provide authentication,
    but need to reduce the granularity of a potential attack.
