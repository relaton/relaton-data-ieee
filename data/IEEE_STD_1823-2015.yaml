abstract:
- content: A power delivery connection between a power adapter and a power using device
    greater than 10 W and up to, but less than 240 W, is defined in this standard.
    A communications link between the power adapter and the mobile power-using device
    is also defined. The communications may be used to coordinate the power delivery
    and provide identification between the power adapter and the power-using device.
    While intended for portable computing and entertainment devices, power adapters
    conforming to this standard may also be used with other devices (including simple
    devices, with no communications capabilities, up to 20 W).
