abstract:
- content: Information on the application, operation and maintenance of high-voltage
    fuses (above 1000 V and through 169 W), distribution enclosed single-pole air
    switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories for use on ac distribution
    systems is provided. These include enclosed, open, and open-link types of distribution
    cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting fuses; distribution enclosed
    single-pole air switches; power fuses, including current-limiting types; outdoor
    and indoor fuse disconnecting switches; fuse supports, mountings, and links, all
    of the type used exclusively with the above; and removable switch blades for certain
    products among the above
