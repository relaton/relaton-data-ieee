abstract:
- content: In many AI scenarios, data and model sharing are essential for supporting
    communication, interaction, and collaboration among multiple computing centers.
    The framework and functional requirements for sharing data and models across multiple
    computing centers is specified in this standard. Three use cases are provided
    for analyzing the standardization requirements and considerations.
