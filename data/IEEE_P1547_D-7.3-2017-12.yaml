abstract:
- content: The technical specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection and
    interoperability between utility electric power systems (EPSs) and distributed
    energy resources (DERs) are the focus of this standard. It provides requirements
    relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance
    of the interconnection. It also includes general requirements, response to abnormal
    conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements
    for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests.
    The stated requirements are universally needed for interconnection of DER, including
    synchronous machines, induction machines, or power inverters/converters and will
    be sufficient for most installations. The criteria and requirements are applicable
    to all DER technologies interconnected to EPSs at typical primary and/or secondary
    distribution voltages. Installation of DER on radial primary and secondary distribution
    systems is the main emphasis of this document, although installation of DERs on
    primary and secondary network distribution systems is considered. This standard
    is written considering that the DER is a 60 Hz source.
