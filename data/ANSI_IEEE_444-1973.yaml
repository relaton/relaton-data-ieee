abstract:
- content: This standard applies to all types of line-commutated semiconductor power
    converters employing monocrystalline semiconductor thyristors or diodes, as used
    in industrial motor-drive applications requiring adjustable direct voltage for
    dc motor armature or field, or adjustable voltage and frequency in the case of
    ac motor drives (cycloconverter). It covers thyristor converter circuits, general
    requirements, test procedures, general recommendations for loading and operating
    converter units, and thyristor converter transformers. Although written primarily
    around the requirements of motor drives needing sufficient power to utilize multiphase
    power converters, this standard is applicable with reasonable interpretation to
    all line-commutated power converters used in industrial motor-drive applications.
