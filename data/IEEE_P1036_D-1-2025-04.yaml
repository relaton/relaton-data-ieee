abstract:
- content: This guide applies to the use of 50 Hz 1 and 60 Hz shunt power capacitors
    rated 2400 Vac and above, and assemblies of such capacitors. Included are guidelines
    for the application, protection, and ratings of equipment for the improved safety
    and reliability in the utilization of shunt power capacitors. The guide is general
    and intended to be basic and supplemental to specific recommendations of the manufacturer.
    The guide covers applications that range from simple capacitor unit utilization
    to complex capacitor bank situations.
