abstract:
- content: Significant aspects of handling SF6 gas used in electric power equipment
    such as gas recovery, reclamation, recycling in order to keep the gas permanently
    in a closed cycle and aid to prevent any deliberate release in environment are
    described. The purpose of this guide is to provide state-of-the-art technologies
    and procedures to reduce SF6 gas emission to a minimum level for the electric
    power equipment to preserve the environment. All the aspects for consideration
    during commissioning and recommissioning, topping up, refilling, checking the
    gas quality at site, sampling and shipment for off-site gas analysis, and recovering
    and reclaiming during normal operation and at the end of the life of power equipment
    while dismantling will be included in this guide. The state-of- the art tools
    and measuring devices including the necessary personnel protective equipment is
    also presented. The basis for the preparation of this guide is CIGRE Brochure
    No. 276, Guide for preparation of customized “Practical SF6 handling instructions,”
    August 2005 edition, developed by the Study Committee B3, Task Force B3.02.01.
