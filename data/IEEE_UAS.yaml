abstract:
- content: This paper discusses the findings of an integrated team that formed to
    identify current IEEE unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) standards and possible research
    gaps. The team identified the list of standards published by the IEEE and validated
    whether the standards had been captured correctly. The team also identified research
    gaps in the current standards and, hence, possible future UAS standards development
    activities. As part of the effort, the team further identified multiple UAS standards
    developed for communications and networking, operations and applications, sensors,
    payload interfaces, and power research areas. The team could not identify any
    specific research gaps in the current standards development activities but did
    note a few IEEE standards development projects that need future research. Overall,
    participants found few general research gaps. In the future, the team should expand
    to include members from all unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) working groups to better
    capture research gaps.
