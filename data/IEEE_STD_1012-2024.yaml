abstract:
- content: The Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) processes are used to determine
    whether the development products of a given activity conform to the requirements
    of that activity and whether the product satisfies its intended use and user needs.
    V&amp;V life cycle process requirements are specified for different integrity
    levels. The scope of V&amp;V processes encompasses systems, software, and hardware,
    and it includes their interfaces. Systems, software, and hardware being developed,
    maintained, or reused [legacy, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), non-developmental
    items] can be the system of interest to which this standard is applied. The term
    software also includes firmware and microcode, and each of the terms system, software,
    and hardware includes related information or documentation. V&amp;V processes
    include the analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment, and testing
    of products.
