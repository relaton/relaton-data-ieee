abstract:
- content: This recommended practice encompasses the monitoring of electrical characteristics
    of single-phase and polyphase ac power systems. It includes consistent descriptions
    of conducted electromagnetic phenomena occurring on power systems. This recommended
    practice describes nominal conditions and deviations from these nominal conditions
    that may originate within the source of supply or load equipment or may originate
    from interactions between the source and the load. Also, this recommended practice
    discusses power quality monitoring devices, application techniques, and the interpretation
    of monitoring results.
