abstract:
- content: VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is defined. VHDL is a formal
    notation intended for use in all phases of the creation of electronic systems.
    Because it is both machine readable and human readable, it supports the development,
    verification, synthesis, and testing of hardware designs; the communication of
    hardware design data; and the maintenance, modification, and procurement of hardware.
    Its primary audiences are the implementors of tools supporting the language and
    the advanced users of the language. (This standard incorporates open source. See
    https://opensource.ieee.org/vasg/Packages)
