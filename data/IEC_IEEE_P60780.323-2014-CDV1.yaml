abstract:
- content: This standard is applicable to electrical equipment important to safety
    and its interfaces thatare necessary to perform a safety function, or whose failure
    could adversely affect, the safetyfunctions of other equipment.Electrical equipment
    in nuclear facilities shall meet its safety functional requirements throughout
    its installed life. This is accomplished by a thorough programme of quality assurance,
    design control, quality control, qualification, production, transportation, storage,
    installation, maintenance, periodic testing, and surveillance. This IEC/IEEE standard
    specifically focuses on qualification.Other aspects, relating to quality assurance,
    reliability, selection and use of electronic devices, design and modification
    of digital systems including V&amp;V activities are not part of this standard.
