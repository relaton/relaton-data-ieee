abstract:
- content: The measurement of frequency response analysis (FRA) of oil-immersed power
    transformers is applicable in this guide. It is intended to provide the user with
    the requirements and specifications for instrumentation, procedures for performing
    the tests, techniques for analyzing the data, and recommendations for long-term
    storage of the data and results.
