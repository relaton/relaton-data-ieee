abstract:
- content: Guidelines are established for the verification, validation, and accreditation
    (VV&amp;A) of distributed interactive simulation (DIS) exercises. “How-to” procedures
    for planning and conducting DIS exercise VV&amp;A are provided. Intended for use
    in conjunction with IEEE Std 1278.3-1996, this recommended practice presents data
    flow and connectivity for all proposed verification and validation activities
    and provides rationale and justification for each step. VV&amp;A guidance is provided
    to exercise users/sponsors and developers.
