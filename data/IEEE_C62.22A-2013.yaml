abstract:
- content: 'New tests added to IEEE Std C62.11&#x2122;-2012: a switching surge energy
    capability test (thermal energy rating), a repetitive single-impulse withstand
    capability test, and the inductive voltage drop effects of the internal arrester
    metal current carrying components determined during the front-of-wave (FOW) discharge
    voltage test are included in this amendment to IEEE Std C62.22&#x2122;-2009.'
