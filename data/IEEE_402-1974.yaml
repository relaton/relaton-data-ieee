abstract:
- content: This guide describes the apparatus and procedures for the determination
    of resistivity and polarization characteristics of solid and laminar insulation
    specimens (considered for use in high direct-voltage power cables) at uniform
    temperatures from room temperature up to the temperature at which the materials
    will operate.
