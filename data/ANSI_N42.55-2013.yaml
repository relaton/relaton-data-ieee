abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to establish requirements and methods of
    test for portable transmission x-ray systems for use in improvised explosive device
    and hazardous device disarming and render safe operations. These systems include
    those that provide still and/or video images. This standard does not apply to
    cabinet x-ray systems, such as those used for security screening, and backscatter
    x-ray systems.
