abstract:
- content: To provide manufacturers and users of board level shielding with appropriate
    methods for the characterization of the shielding effectiveness of the board level
    shields themselves as well as the way they are mounted on the printed circuit
    board. This document will guide the user in the selection of the appropriate test
    method in order to determine the level of shielding provided in the intended application.
