abstract:
- content: This document provides a common vocabulary applicable to all systems and
    software engineering work. It was prepared to collect and standardize terminology.
    This document is intended to serve as a useful reference for those in the information
    technology field, and to encourage the use of systems and software engineering
    standards prepared by ISO and liaison organizations IEEE Computer Society and
    Project Management Institute. This document includes references to the active
    source standards for definitions so that systems and software engineering concepts
    and requirements can be further explored.
