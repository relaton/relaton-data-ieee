abstract:
- content: This guide establishes selection criteria that is used to determine representative
    components or devices and assembly specimen configurations (both indoor and outdoor)
    to test as part of seismic qualification efforts for attaining building code seismic
    conformance for nonstructural equipment in commercial and industrial applications.
    Additionally, guidance for specific acceptance criteria is provided.
