abstract:
- content: This standard provides methods for determining antenna factors of antennas
    used for radiated emission measurements of electromagnetic interference (EMI)
    from 30 MHz to 1000 MHz. Antennas included are linearly polarized antennas such
    as tuned dipoles, biconical dipoles, log-periodic arrays, etc, which are used
    in measurements governed by ANSI C63.4-1988. The methods include standard site,
    reference antennas, standard antenna, and standard field methods. The latter two
    methods are incorporated by reference.
