abstract:
- content: This guide describes methods for selecting the appropriate type of valve-regulated,
    immobilized-electrolyte, recombinant lead-acid battery for any of a variety of
    stationary float applications. The purpose of this document is to ensure that
    the reader is aware of all significant issues that should be considered when selecting
    VRLA batteries, so that the user might make an informed decision.
