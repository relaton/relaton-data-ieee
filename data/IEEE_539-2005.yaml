abstract:
- content: Definitions and usage of terms used in the measurement and analysis of
    corona and field effects of overhead power lines are presented in this standard.
    Correlation between measurements from equipment to standard terms is defined.
    Weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and drizzle are defined and their
    measurement standards discussed. The intent is to assist in correlating standard
    terms found in literature and requirements to standard engineering practice.
