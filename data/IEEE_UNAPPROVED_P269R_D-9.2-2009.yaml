abstract:
- content: Practical methods for making laboratory measurements of electroacoustic
    characteristics of analog and digital telephones, handsets and headsets. The methods
    may also be applicable to a wide variety of other communications equipment, including
    cordless, wireless and mobile communications devices. Measurement results may
    be used to evaluate these devices on a standardized basis. Application is in the
    frequency range from 100 to 8,500 Hz. This edition incorporates IEEE 269a-2007,
    "IEEE Std. for Methods for Measuring Transmission Performance of Analog and Digital
    Telephone Sets, Handsets, and Headsets, Amendment 1." Other substantive changes
    have been made since the 2002 edition.
