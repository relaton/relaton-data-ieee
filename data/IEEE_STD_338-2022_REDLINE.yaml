abstract:
- content: Criteria for the performance of periodic surveillance testing of nuclear
    power generating station safety systems are provided in this standard. The scope
    of periodic surveillance testing consists of functional tests and checks, calibration
    verification, and time response measurements, as required, to verify that the
    safety system performs its defined safety function. Post-maintenance and post-modification
    testing are not covered by this document. The periodic surveillance testing requirements
    of IEEE NPEC nuclear standards are amplified in this standard. Some design requirements
    are also identified in this standard.
