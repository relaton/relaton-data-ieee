abstract:
- content: This guide applies to electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) with a rated
    supply voltage up to 1000 V alternating current (AC) or up to 1500 V direct current
    (DC) and a rated output voltage up to 1500 V DC. This guide specifies a method
    of condition evaluation of EVSE, including general principles, condition evaluation
    method, and the classification.
