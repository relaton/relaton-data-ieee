abstract:
- content: This standard specifies how all or part of a network can be secured transparently
    to peer protocol entities that use the MAC Service provided by IEEE 802(R) LANs
    to communicate. MAC security (MACsec) provides connectionless user data confidentiality,
    frame data integrity, and data origin authenticity.
