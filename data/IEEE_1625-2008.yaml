abstract:
- content: This standard guides manufacturers/suppliers in planning and implementing
    the controls for the design and manufacture of lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-ion
    polymer (Li-ion polymer) rechargeable battery packs used for multi-cell mobile
    computing devices. The provisions of this standard work together to define approaches
    to design, test, and evaluate a cell, battery pack, and host device to mitigate
    battery system failure. Additionally, this standard provides recommendations for
    end-user education and communication materials. This approach recommends the interfaces
    between subsystems (for example, cell, battery pack, host device, power adapter,
    etc.), and end users are as important to system reliability as is robust subsystem
    design and testing. This standard, therefore, includes subsystem interface design
    responsibilities for each subsystem manufacturer/supplier, and it provides messaging
    and communication provisions for end-user awareness. Therefore, the responsibility
    for total system reliability is shared between the designers/manufacturers/suppliers
    of the subsystems and the end user. Compliance to this standard requires adherence
    to all the provisions of the standard.
