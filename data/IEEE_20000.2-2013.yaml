abstract:
- content: Guidance on the application of service management systems (SMS) based on
    the requirements in IEEE Std 20000-2-2013 (ISO/IEC 20000-1) is provided in this
    adoption of ISO/IEC 20000-2:2012. This standard enables organizations and individuals
    to interpret ISO/IEC 20000-1 more accurately and therefore to use it more effectively.
    The guidance includes examples and suggestions to enable organizations to interpret
    and apply ISO/IEC 20000-1, including references to other parts of ISO/IEC 20000
    and other relevant standards. This includes guidance on the use of an SMS for
    the planning, design, transition, delivery and improvement of the SMS and services.
    At a minimum this includes service management policies, objectives, plans, service
    management processes, process interfaces, documentation, and resources. The SMS
    provides ongoing control, greater effectiveness, efficiency, and opportunities
    for continual improvement of service management and of services. It enables an
    organization to work effectively with a shared vision.
