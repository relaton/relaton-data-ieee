- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Jan 15, 2001. No longer endorsed by
    the IEEE. The mechanical design requirements for a military module, format E form
    factor are established. The specificaitons of dimensions and tolerances are intended
    to ensure the mechanical intermateability of military modules within associated
    subracks. Mechanical characteristics for military applications are also included.'
