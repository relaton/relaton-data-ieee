abstract:
- content: An evaluation framework for the intelligence capabilities of artificial
    intelligence (AI) dialogue systems such as chatbots, consulting terminals, or
    operation interfaces is established in this recommended practice. The recommended
    practice classifies the intelligence capabilities of an AI dialogue system into
    three categories—cognitive intelligence, emotional intelligence, and system completeness.
    For each class, the capabilities are subdivided into five intelligence levels,
    from the lowest level L1 to the highest level L5, with the performance criteria
    clarified at each level by an evaluation checklist.
