abstract:
- content: Provided in this guide are information and recommendations on the equipment,
    cable specimens, test conditions, test control methodologies, measurements, data
    analysis, and interpretation in performing accelerated aging tests for 5 kV to
    46 kV rated cables using water-filled tanks. The accelerated aging tests may be
    time-to-failure tests and/or tests in which the samples are aged for fixed times
    followed by diagnostic testing.
