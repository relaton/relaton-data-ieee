abstract:
- content: Replaced by 930-2004. This guide describes, with examples, statistical
    methods to analyze the data for time-to-failure from constant-stress voltage endurance
    tests or breakdown voltage from progressive-stress tests on specimens or systems
    of electrical insulation. Methods to compare test data are also given. The methods
    are principally applied to data from tests on solid insulation, but may also apply
    to the analyses of data from tests on gas, liquid, and composite systems. The
    statistical methods discussed here do not take into consideration the physical
    mechanism of voltage aging. The methods assume that the only aging stress is alternating
    voltage of constant frequency. The methods may not apply if there is more than
    one aging stress. Methods to ascertain the short time withstand voltage or operating
    voltage of an insulation system are not presented in this guide. The mathematical
    techniques contained in this guide may not directly apply to the estimation of
    equipment life.
