    (Revision of IEEE Std 1029.1-1991) This standard is a formal notation intended
    for use in all phases of the development of electronic systems. Because it is
    both machine-readable and human-readable, it supports the veriÞcation and testing
    of hardware designs; the communication of hardware design and test veriÞcation
    data; and the maintenance, modification, and procurement of hardware systems.
    This standard provides the syntactic and semantic framework for the unambiguous
    expression and aggregation of digital test data and timing information necessary
    to completely describe a test or set of tests for a digital system. WAVES digital
    test data (stimulus and expected responses) is described at the logic level. Voltage
    and current values are not described by WAVES and are beyond the scope of this
    standard.
