- content: Methods for determining antenna factors of antennas used for radiated emission
    measurements in electromagnetic interference (EMI) control from 9 kHz to 40 GHz
    are provided. Antennas included are linearly polarized antennas such as loops,
    rods (monopoles), tuned dipoles, biconical dipoles, log-periodic dipole arrays,
    biconical and log-periodic dipole array hybrids, broadband horns, etc., that are
    used in measurements prescribed by ANSI C63.4 and ANSI C63.10. The antenna calibration
    methods include standard site method (i.e., three-antenna method), reference antenna
    method, equivalent capacitance substitution method, standard transmit loop method,
    standard antenna method, and standard field method. The selection of attenuation
    in 5.1.1 e) is addressed in this corrigendum, such that a maximum VSWR of 2:1
    is achieved.
