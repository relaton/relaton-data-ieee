abstract:
- content: A protocol is provided in this standard that enables precise synchronization
    of clocks in measurement and control systems implemented with technologies such
    as network communication, local computing, and distributed objects. The protocol
    is applicable to systems communicating via packet networks. Heterogeneous systems
    are enabled that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and
    stability to synchronize. System-wide synchronization accuracy and precision in
    the sub-microsecond range are supported with minimal network and local clock computing
    resources. Simple systems are installed and operated without requiring the management
    attention of users because the default behavior of the protocol allows for it.

- content: This standard defines a protocol enabling precise synchronization of clocks
    in measurement and control systems implemented with technologies such as network
    communication, local computing and distributed objects. The protocol is applicable
    to systems communicating by local area networks supporting multicast messaging
    including but not limited to Ethernet. The protocol enables heterogeneous systems
    that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability to
    synchronize to a grandmaster clock. The protocol supports system-wide synchronization
    accuracy in the sub-microsecond range with minimal network and local clock computing
    resources. The default behavior of the protocol allows simple systems to be installed
    and operated without requiring the administrative attention of users. The standard
    includes mappings to UDP/IP, DeviceNet and a layer-2 Ethernet implementation.
