abstract:
- content: A method for sizing both vented and valve-regulated lead-acid batteries
    used in terrestrial photovoltaic (PV)systems is described.Installation,maintenance,safety,testing
    procedures,and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond
    the scope of this document.Recom- mended practices for the remainder of the electrical
    systems associated with PV installations are also beyond the scope of this document.
