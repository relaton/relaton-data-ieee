abstract:
- content: The standard helps procurement teams reduce risks in artificial intelligence
    systems (AIS) by using tailored risk management practices when purchasing AIS.
    Specific process steps for AIS problem definition, solicitation preparation, vendor
    and solution evaluation, contract negotiation, and contract monitoring are described.
    Risk management methodologies that augment customary activities and tasks performed
    during the procurement life cycle are provided including identifying, analyzing,
    evaluating, prioritizing, mitigating, and controlling unique AIS risks that can
    detract from unique AIS benefits. How procurement teams can use and apply practical
    AIS tools and metrics is also provided. The standard focuses explicitly on AIS
    risks (when compared to traditional, non-AIS technology) and is designed to address
    the purchase of commercial AI products and services procured using a formal contract
    or contract framework.
