abstract:
- content: The scope of this recommended practice is restricted to the recommendation
    of nominal dimensions for toroidal strip-wound cores made from magnetic tape between
    approximately 0.014 and 0.005 inch in thickness and without regard to the type
    of magnetic material used. Bobbin-wound cores of ultra-thin magnetic tapes are
    not included. Also excluded from consideration are recommendations on dimensional
    tolerances, space factors, number of wraps of tape, core case shape or size, and
    particular values of strip thickness.
