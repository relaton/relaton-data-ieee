abstract:
- content: Methods for designing 110 kV to 1000 kV ac overhead transmission lines
    are provided and may also be used as reference for the design of lower voltage
    overhead transmission lines. The principles and procedures for designing weather-resistant
    conductor, ground wire, insulator, structure, and foundation of ac transmission
    overhead lines are specified.
