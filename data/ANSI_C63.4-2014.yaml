abstract:
- content: U.S. consensus standard methods, instrumentation, and facilities for measurement
    of radio-frequency (RF) signals and noise emitted from electrical and electronic
    devices in the frequency range of 9 kHz to 40 GHz are specified. This standard
    does not include generic or product-specific emission limits. Where possible,
    the specifications herein are harmonized with other national and international
    standards used for similar purposes.
