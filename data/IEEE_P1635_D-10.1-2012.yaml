abstract:
- content: Ventilation of stationary battery installations is critical to maximize
    battery life while minimizing the hazards associated with hydrogen production.
    This guide is applicable to vented lead acid, valve-regulated lead acid, and nickel
    cadmium stationary battery installations and was written to serve as a bridge
    between the electrical designer and the HVAC designer. It describes battery operating
    modes and the hazards associated with each. It provides the HVAC designer with
    the information to provide a cost effective ventilation solution.
