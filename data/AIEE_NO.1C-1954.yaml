abstract:
- content: This test code has been prepared in the hope that it will serve as a useful
    guide for the evaluation of insulation systems for random wound rotating electric
    machines, and to establish a sound basis for their temperature classification.
    Once this is accomplished in orderly and organized fashion, the problems of insulation
    selection for use in electric apparatus should be simplified. The code defines
    test procedures. It does not establish any normal values for insulation life,
    nor does it provide any standards of performance whatever.
