abstract:
- content: Capacitors and assemblies of capacitors, insulation means, switching, protective
    equipment, and control accessories that form a complete bank for inserting in
    series with a transmission line are applied. Included are requirements for safety,
    rating, and protective device levels. Functional requirements for alarm devices,
    maintenance, design and production tests, and a guide for operation are included.
    Functional requirements for protective devices are addressed, including varistors
    and bypass gaps.
