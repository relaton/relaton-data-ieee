abstract:
- content: 'The following enclosed low-voltage ac power circuit breakers are covered
    in this standard: a) stationary or draw-out type of two-, three-, or four-pole
    construction, with one or more rated maximum voltages of 635 V (600 V for units
    incorporating fuses), 508 V, and 254 V for application on systems having nominal
    voltages of 600 V, 480 V, and 240 V; b) unfused or fused circuit breakers; c)
    manually or power operated; and d) with or without electromechanical or electronic
    trip devices. Service conditions, ratings, functional components, temperature
    limitations and classifications of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric)
    withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application are discussed
    in this standard.'
