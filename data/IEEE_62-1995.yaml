abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed 2005 Diagnostic tests and measurements that are performed in
    the field on oil-immersed power transformers and regulators are described. Whenever
    possible, shunt reactors are treated in a similar manner to transformers. Tests
    are presented systematically in categories depending on the subsystem of the unit
    being examined. A diagnostic chart is included as an aid to identify the various
    subsystems. Additional information is provided regarding specialized test and
    measuring techniques.
