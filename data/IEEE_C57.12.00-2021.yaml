abstract:
- content: 'Electrical and mechanical requirements for liquid-immersed distribution
    and power transformers, and autotransformers and regulating transformers; single-phase
    and polyphase, with voltages of 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding,
    are set forth. This standard is a basis for the establishment of performance,
    and limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability requirements of equipment
    are described; it is also a basis for assistance in the proper selection of such
    equipment. The requirements in this standard apply to all liquid-immersed distribution,
    power, and regulating transformers except the following: instrument transformers,
    step voltage and induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier
    transformers, specialty transformers, grounding transformers, mobile transformers,
    and mine transformers.'
