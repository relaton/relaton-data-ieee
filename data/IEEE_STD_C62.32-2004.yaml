abstract:
- content: This standard applies to air gaps for overvoltage protection applications
    on systems with operating voltages equal to or less than 600 V rms. This standard
    contains a series of standard tests for determining the electrical characteristics
    of these air gap devices. This standard's test criteria and definitions provide
    a common engineering language beneficial to users and manufacturers of air gap
    surge protective devices.
