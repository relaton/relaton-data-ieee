abstract:
- content: This standard describes a methodology for accessing instrumentation embedded
    within a semiconductor device without defining the instruments or their features
    themselves, via the IEEE 1149.1 Test Access Port (TAP) and/or other signals. The
    elements of the methodology include a hardware architecture for the on-chip network
    connecting the instruments to the chip pins, a hardware description language to
    describe this network, and a software language and protocol for communicating
    with the instruments via this network.
