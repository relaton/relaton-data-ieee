abstract:
- content: The independence requirements of the circuits and equipment comprising
    or associated with Class 1E systems are described. Criteria for the independence
    that can be achieved by physical separation and electrical isolation of circuits
    and equipment that are redundant are set forth. The determination of what is to
    be considered redundant is not addressed.
