abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations
    and Protective Relays. Guidelines are established for synthetic testing of circuit
    breakers, as well as test criteria for demonstrating the short-circuit current
    rating of circuit breakers on a single-phase basis. Criteria for evaluating results
    are also provided. The standard covers short-circuit current interruption process;
    basic principles of synthetic testing; synthetic test circuits; requirements for
    synthetic test methods; parameters, test procedures, and tolerances; short-line
    fault; multiple loops; circuit breakers equipped with parallel impedance; duty
    cycle; and test records.
