abstract:
- content: A serial highway (SH) system using byte-organized messages and configured
    as a unidirectional loop, to which are connected a system controller and up to
    sixty-two CAMAC crate assemblies, is defined. In the primary application, the
    controlled devices are CAMAC crate assemblies with serial crate controllers that
    conform to a defined message structure. In other applications, some or all of
    the controlled devices connected to the SH can be equipment that conforms to a
    subset of the full specification and is not necessarily constructed in CAMAC format
    or controlled by CAMAC commands.
