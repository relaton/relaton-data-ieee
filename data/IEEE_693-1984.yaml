abstract:
- content: Guidelines and criteria for the design of substations that can withstand
    the effects of earthquakes are provided. These recommendations comprise an up-to-date
    summary of aseismic design practices that will be useful to substation engineers
    for effective aseismic design of substations and related facilities. Seismic criteria
    and performance requirements are set forth, qualification methods are discussed,
    and design and construction practices are presented.
