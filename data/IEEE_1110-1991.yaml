abstract:
- content: Superseded by 1110-2002. Three direct-axis and four quadrature-axis models
    are categorized, along with the basic transient reactance model. Some of the assumptions
    made in using various models, including the basic model, are discussed, and the
    fundamental equations and concepts involved in generator/system interfacing are
    presented. The various attributes of power system stability are covered in a general
    way, with two basic approaches being recognized. The first is categorized under
    large-disturbance nonlinear analysis. The second approach considers small disturbances,
    where the corresponding dynamic equations are linearized. Applications of a range
    of generator models are discussed and treated. The manner in which generator saturation
    is treated in stability studies, both in the initialization process, as well as
    during large or small disturbance stability analysis procedures is addressed.
    Saturation functions that are derived either from test data or by the methods
    of finite elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating
    values of excitation and internal power angle, depending upon generator terminal
    conditions, are compared. The question of parameter determination is thoroughly
    covered. Two approaches in accounting for generator field and excitation system
    base quantities are identified. Conversion factors are given for transferring
    field parameters from one base to another for correct generator/excitation system
    interface modeling. Suggestions for modeling of negative field currents and other
    field circuit discontinuities are included.
