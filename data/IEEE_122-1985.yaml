abstract:
- content: 'Superseded by 122-1991. Minimum functional and performance characteristics
    related to speed/load-control systems for steam turbine-generator units that may
    be interconnected on a power system are recommended. The recommendations apply
    to the following types of steam turbines, rated at 500 kW and larger, intended
    to drive electric generators at constant speed without initial steam-pressure
    control, exhaust steam pressure control, or either: (1) condensing or noncondensing
    turbines without initial steam-pressure control, exhaust steam-pressure control,
    or either, including turbines used with reheat, regenerative feedwater heaters,
    or both; (2) condensing or noncondensing turbines with initial and/or exhaust
    steam-pressure control, including turbines used with reheat, regenerative feedwater
    heaters, or both; (3) automatic extraction and/or induction and mixed-pressure
    turbines. Emergency governors, other overspeed control devices, and, in general,
    devices that are not responsive to speed are not covered.'
