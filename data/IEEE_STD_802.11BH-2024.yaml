abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies modifications to the IEEE Std 802.11 medium access
    control (MAC) sublayer mechanisms to preserve the existing services that might
    otherwise be restricted in environments where STAs in extended service set (ESS)
    use randomized or changing MAC addresses, without affecting the privacy of the
    users corresponding to the STAs. User privacy includes exposure of trackable information
    to third parties or exposure of an individual’s presence of behavior. This amendment
    introduces mechanisms to enable session continuity in the absence of unique MAC
    address-to-STA mapping. For STAs in an ESS that use randomized or changing MAC
    addresses, this amendment preserves the ability to provide customer support, conduct
    network diagnostics and troubleshooting, and detect device arrival in a trusted
    environment.
