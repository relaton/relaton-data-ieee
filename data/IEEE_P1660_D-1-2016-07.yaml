abstract:
- content: Information on the differences between stationary standby and stationary
    cycling applications and appropriate battery management strategies in cycling
    operations is covered in this guide. While the primary emphasis is on lead-acid
    batteries, information is also provided on alternative and emerging storage technologies.
    The management of battery systems in stationary standby service is covered in
    other IEEE documents and is beyond the scope of this guide.
