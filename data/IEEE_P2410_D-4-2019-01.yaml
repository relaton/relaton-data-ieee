abstract:
- content: Identity assertion, role gathering, multilevel access control, assurance,
    and auditing are provided by the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS). An implementation
    of the BOPS III spec is described, which includes both the software running on
    the client device as well as the server. Pluggable components are allowed to replace
    existing components’ functionality, accepting integration into current operating
    environments in a short period of time. A “point-and-cut” mechanism to add the
    appropriate security to both development and production systems is offered through
    the BOPS implementation functionality. Homomorphic encryption and a tremendous
    simplification of the API are also described.
