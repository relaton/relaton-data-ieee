abstract:
- content: The characteristics of the various transformer connections and possible
    operating problems under normal or abnormal conditions are treated for three-phase
    distribution systems. These systems are characterized by primary voltages up to
    and including 34.5 kV, usually have a preponderance of connected transformers
    with low-voltage windings below 1000 V, and furnish electric service to consumers.
    All combinations of Delta and Y, grounded and ungrounded, T connected, zigzag,
    and certain special connections are considered. Only two-winding transformers
    are included. Phasing procedures and loading practices are not covered.
