abstract:
- content: 'This document complements the architecture-related processes identified
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, and ISO 15704 with activities and tasks
    that enable architects and others to more effectively and efficiently implement
    architecture practices. Implementing these practices will help ensure that the
    architecture has greater influence on business and mission success. It specifies
    a coherent set of processes for governance, management, conceptualization, evaluation
    and elaboration of architectures, and activities that enable these processes.
    Users of this standard can apply these processes in the context of: (1) understanding,
    development and evolution of entities through their life cycle stages such as
    conception, development, implementation, operation, sustainment, decommissioning,
    and disposal; (2) organization(s) acting as users, customers and providers of
    the solution specified by the architecture description; and (3) architecting of
    entities.'
