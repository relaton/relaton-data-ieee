abstract:
- content: Instruction for the testing of distribution transformers as sources of
    voice-frequency noise for communication circuits is provided. The tests measure
    the degree to which a transformer may contribute to electrical noise in communication
    circuits that are physically paralleling the power-supply circuits feeding the
    transformer. They provide a standard method for use by the transformer manufacturer,
    user, and others in the industry for the purpose of better evaluating the design
    choices that are available and moving toward industry objectives with regard to
    levels of harmonic exciting current.
