abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE 344-2004. Recommended practices for establishing procedures
    that will yield data that verify that the Class 1E equipment can meet its performance
    requirements during and following one safe shutdown earthquake preceded by a number
    of operating-basis earthquakes are provided. This recommended practice may be
    used to establish tests or analyses that will yield data to substantiate performance
    claims or to evaluate and verify performance of representative devices and assemblies
    as part of an overall qualification effort. Two approaches to seismic analysis
    are described, one based on dynamic analysis and the other on static coefficient
    analysis. Common methods currently in use for seismic qualification by test are
    presented.
