abstract:
- content: In this guide, the field testing methodology and techniques are presented
    for measuring electrical parameters of AC transmission lines. The topics will
    include safety precautions; requirements for measuring instruments; measurement
    of induced voltage and current; phase verification and insulation resistance measurement;
    DC resistance measurement; off-line parameter measurement of symmetrical transmission
    line; off-line parameter measurement of asymmetrical transmission lines; eliminating
    power frequency interference during off-line measurement; zero-sequence parameter
    measurement with adjacent lines in operation and on-line parameter measurement
    of transmission lines.
