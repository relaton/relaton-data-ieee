abstract:
- content: 'The application of standstill frequency response testing methods for obtaining
    direct- and quadrature-axis stability parameters is described. Measurable parameters
    at standstill are discussed, and the test method is described. This standard is
    a supplement to ANSI/IEEE Std 115-1983, IEEE Guide: Test Procedures for Synchronous
    Machines.'
