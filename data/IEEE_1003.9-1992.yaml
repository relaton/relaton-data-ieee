abstract:
- content: This standard provides a standardized interface for accessing the system
    services of ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 (IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, also know as POSIX.1),
    and support routines to access constructs not directly accessible with FORTRAN
    77. This standard supports application portability at the source level through
    the binding between ANSI X3.9-1978 and POSIX.1, and a standardized definition
    of language-specific services. The goal is to provide standardized interfaces
    to the POSIX.1 system services via a FORTRAN 77 language interface. Terminology
    and general requirements, process primitives, the process environment, files and
    directories, input and output primitives, device- and class-specific functions,
    the FORTRAN 77 language library, and system databases are covered.
