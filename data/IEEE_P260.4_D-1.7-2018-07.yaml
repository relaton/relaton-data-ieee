abstract:
- content: 'Tables of letter symbols and abbreviations for quantities in the science
    and technology of acoustics are contained in this standard. Recommendations for
    their use are also provided. Specialties within acoustics that make use of the
    letter symbols and abbreviations within this standard include, but are not limited
    to: speech, hearing, music, noise control, vibration, shock, sonar, and transducers.
    Although remarks and limited short-form information are provided for many of the
    symbols and abbreviations contained in this standard, definitions and methods
    of calculating the various quantities are outside the scope of this standard.'
