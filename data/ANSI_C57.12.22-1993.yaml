abstract:
- content: This standard is intended for use as a basis for determining performance,
    interchangeability, andsafety of the equipment covered, and to assist in the proper
    selection of such equipment.This standard covers certain electrical, dimensional,
    and mechanical characteristics and takesinto consideration certain safety features
    of three-phase, 60 Hz., mineral-oil-immersed, self-cooled, padmounted,compartmental-type
    distribution transformers with high-voltage bushings. These transformers are rated
    2500 kVA and smaller, with high voltages of 34 500 GrdY/19 920 volts and below,
    and with low voltages of 480 volts and below. These transformers are generally
    used for step-down purposes from an underground primary cable supply.
