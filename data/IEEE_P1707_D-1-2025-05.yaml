abstract:
- content: Common terminology and recommended practices for initiating and conducting,
    event investigations, analyzing data, producing results, and identifying corrective
    actions associated with facility personnel, processes, equipment, and systems
    at nuclear facilities are provided in this document. The scope of event investigation
    activities addressed includes, but is not limited to, root cause analysis, which
    is an in-depth investigation process used to identify primary causes of an event
    based on the systematic and consistent use of analysis tools. This recommended
    practice can be used for the investigation of all events and allows the use of
    a graduated approach to the depth of the investigation based upon the event significance.
