- content: 'The application, installation, operation, and maintenance of single- and
    polyphase dry-type general purpose, distribution, power, and autotransformers
    are covered. The following types are included: ventilated, indoor and outdoor,
    self- or forced-air cooled; nonventilated, indoor and outdoor, self- or forced-air
    cooled; and sealed, indoor and outdoor, self-cooled. Instrument transformers,
    step voltage and induction-voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier
    transformers, and specialty transformers are not covered.'
