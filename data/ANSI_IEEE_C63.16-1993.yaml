abstract:
- content: Based upon ESD events on electronic equipment in actual-use environments,
    a process to establish ESD test criteria is provided. Test procedures for highly
    repeatable ESD immunity evaluation of tabletop and floor-standing equipment are
    described. Simulator characteristics for hand/metal and furniture ESD testing
    are specified both for air and contact discharge methods. Statistical criteria
    is given to determine the number of test trials required, based on the confidence
    factor desired and various pass/fail categories. This ANSI ESD guide has been
    harmonized with other international ESD standards except where other standards
    have technical approaches that would reduce equipment quality or result in degraded
    product operation.
