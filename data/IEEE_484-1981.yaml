abstract:
- content: Large stationary lead storage batteries play an ever increasing role in
    substation and generating station control and power systems and in providing the
    back-up energy for emergencies. This Recommended Practice fulfills the need within
    the industry to provide common or standard practices for the design of battery
    installations and the battery installation procedures. The methods described are
    applicable to all installations and battery sizes.
