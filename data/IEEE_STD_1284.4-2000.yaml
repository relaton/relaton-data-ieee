abstract:
- content: A device to carry on multiple, concurrent exchanges of data and/or control
    information with another device across a single point-to-point link allowed by
    the packet protocol is described in this standard. The protocol is not a device
    control language. The protocol provides basic transport-level flow control and
    multiplexing services. The multiplexed information exchanges are independent,
    and blocking of one has no effect on any other. The protocol shall operate over
    inter-faces such as described in IEEE Std 1284-2000.
