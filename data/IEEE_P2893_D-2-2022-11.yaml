abstract:
- content: A communication layer, Flexible Optical Service Unit (OSUFlex), to provide
    small service channels in optical transport networks is specified in this standard.
    The main features of the OSUflex communication layer are providing massive OSUflex
    connections to directly carry power services (e.g., E1 or IEEE Std C37.94&#8482;)
    into an optical transport network, enabling the flexible bandwidth (e.g., n x
    2 Mb/s) and hitless bandwidth adjustment for each OSUflex connection, direct mapping
    of services into OSUflex with the capabilities of high-bandwidth efficiency, low
    latency, low latency jitter, and high-precision clock synchronization for power
    system applications.
