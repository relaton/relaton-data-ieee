abstract:
- content: Verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes are used to determine whether
    the development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that
    activity and whether the product satisfies its intended use and user needs. V&amp;V
    life cycle process requirements are specified for different integrity levels.
    The scope of V&amp;V processes encompasses systems, software, and hardware, and
    it includes their interfaces. This standard applies to systems, software, and
    hardware being developed, maintained, or reused (legacy, commercial off-the-shelf
    [COTS], non-developmental items). The term software also includes firmware and
    microcode, and each of the terms system, software, and hardware includes documentation.
    V&amp;V processes include the analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment,
    and testing of products.
