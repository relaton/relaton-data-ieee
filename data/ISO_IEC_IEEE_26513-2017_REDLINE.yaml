abstract:
- content: This document supports the need for software users to receive consistent,
    complete, accurate, and usable documentation. This document was developed to assist
    those who review, assess, and test software user documentation as part of the
    software lifecycle process. It is not limited to the review and test phase of
    the software lifecycle, but includes activities throughout the information management
    and documentation management processes. This document applies to printed and electronic
    documentation such as user manuals, online help, instructions, user assistance,
    tutorials, websites, and user reference documentation. Much of its guidance is
    applicable to user documentation for systems as well as the software used to control
    machinery or hardware devices. It applies to both initial development and subsequent
    releases of the software and user documentation. This document is intended for
    use by all types of organizations, whether or not a dedicated documentation department
    is present. Readers are assumed to have experience with or general knowledge of
    reviewing and testing processes.
