abstract:
- content: A definition, terminology, conceptual model, and standard metrics for ad
    hoc network communication at the nanoscale are provided. Human-engineered networking
    is extended by the physical properties of nanoscale communication in ways beyond
    that defined in existing communication standards. These include in vivo, sub-cellular
    medical communication, smart materials and sensing at the molecular level, and
    the ability to operate in environments that would be too harsh for macroscale
    communication mechanisms to operate. Collaboration among a highly diverse set
    of disciplines with differing definitions and connotations for some terms is required
    by nanoscale communication, thus a common terminology is necessary in order to
    aid inter-discipline collaboration. A common framework for thinking abstractly
    about nanoscale communication can aid in defining and relating research and development
    effort. Components of the framework are independent enough to allow them to be
    developed in relative isolation, yet the components are also interoperable. To
    illustrate the recommended practice, example mappings between specific nanoscale
    communication use-cases and the common framework are included. Simulation code
    implementing the common framework for both wireless and molecular nanoscale communication
    is an embodiment of the common framework demonstrating precisely how the framework
    is applied.
