abstract:
- content: An extensible IEEE 802(R) media access independent services framework (i.e.,
    function and protocol) is defined that enables the optimization of services including
    handover and other services when performed between heterogeneous IEEE 802 networks.
    These services are facilitated by this standard when networking between IEEE 802
    networks and cellular networks. (The PDF of this standard is available at no cost
    compliments of the IEEE GET program http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/)
