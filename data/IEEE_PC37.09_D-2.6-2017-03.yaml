abstract:
- content: 'The testing procedures for all high-voltage circuit breakers that include
    voltage ratings above 1000 V ac and comprise both indoor and outdoor types having
    the preferred ratings as listed in IEEE Std C37.04(TM) are covered. Typical circuit
    breakers covered by these standards have maximum voltage ratings from 4.76 kV
    through 800 kV, and continuous current ratings of 600 A through 5000 A associated
    with the various maximum voltage ratings. The test procedures verify all assigned
    ratings, including continuous current, dielectric withstand voltages, short-circuit
    current, transient recovery voltage, and capacitor switching, plus associated
    capabilities such as mechanical endurance, load current, and out-of-phase switching.
    Production test procedures are also included. This standard does not cover generator
    circuit breakers as these are covered in IEC/IEEE 62271-37-013. (Note: IEEE Std
    C37.09-2018 requires the use of a color monitor (and color printer) to view many
    of the graphics contained in this standard. Color is essential to the understanding
    of the graphics.)'
