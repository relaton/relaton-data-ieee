abstract:
- content: This content has been transferred from the main text, since today's predominant
    bushing technology does not suffer from flashover during conditions of uneven
    wetting, in comparison to the earlier used ceramic insulators. Today's outdoor
    bushings in HVDC applications are made with composite insulators with silicon
    sheds with well proven hydrophobicity. Furthermore, there exist no verified test
    method with sufficient reproducibility between different laboratories. It is also
    difficult for operators to have full knowledge or clear data on how to arrange
    a test setup that reflects actual site conditions. Subsequently, uneven wetting
    test is not relevant for composite insulators. The testing may still be performed
    to outdoor bushings, particularly with ceramic insulators, but shall be agreed
    between purchaser and manufacturer.
