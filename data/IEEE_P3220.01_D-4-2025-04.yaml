abstract:
- content: The consensus framework used in blockchain technology to make the blockchain
    state data consistent within the distributed network environment is defined by
    this standard. The definition of the blockchain consensus mechanism, the protocol
    standard followed, the type of consensus algorithm, and the relevant scenarios
    are the primary focus. A practical approach for blockchain projects, which helps
    develop appropriate consensus mechanisms faster and more comprehensively, is also
    provided by the standard. Regulators and users are also provided with an authoritative
    reference source.
