abstract:
- content: This Test Procedure covers instructions for conducting and reporting the
    more generally applicable and acceptable tests to determine the performance characteristics
    of polyphase induction motors having liquid in the magnetic gap. Constants in
    several equations and forms apply to three-phase motors only and require modification
    for application to motors having another number of phases. It is not intended
    that the Procedure cover all possible tests or tests of a research nature. The
    Procedure shall not be interpreted as requiring the making of any or all of the
    tests described herein in any given transaction.
