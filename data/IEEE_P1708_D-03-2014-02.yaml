abstract:
- content: Within the context of the IEEE P1708 standard, it establishes a normative
    definition of wearable cuffless blood pressure measuring devices and the objective
    evaluation of this kind of devices. The standard is independent of the form of
    the device or the vehicle the device is attached to or embedded in. The standard
    is applicable to all types of wearable BP measurement devices that have different
    modes of operation (e.g. to measure short-term, long-term, snapshot, continuous,
    beat(s)-to-beat(s) BP or BP variability). This standard is, however, limited to
    evaluation of devices that does not use a cuff during measurement and does not
    cover evaluation of all sphygmomanometers that are used with an occluding or inflatable
    cuff for the indirect determination of BP on the upper arm or wrist. This standard
    provides guidelines for manufacturers to qualify and validate their products,
    potential purchasers or users to evaluate and select prospective products, and
    health care professionals to understand the manufacturing practices on wearable
    BP devices.
