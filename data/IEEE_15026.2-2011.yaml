abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 is adopted by this standard. ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011
    specifies minimum requirements for the structure and contents of an assurance
    case to improve the consistency and comparability of assurance cases and to facilitate
    stakeholder communications, engineering decisions, and other uses of assurance
    cases. An assurance case includes a top-level claim for a property of a system
    or product (or set of claims), systematic argumentation regarding this claim,
    and the evidence and explicit assumptions that underlie this argumentation. Arguing
    through multiple levels of subordinate claims, this structured argumentation connects
    the top-level claim to the evidence and assumptions. Assurance cases are generally
    developed to support claims in areas such as safety, reliability, maintainability,
    human factors, operability, and security, although these assurance cases are often
    called by more specific names, e.g. safety case or reliability and maintainability
    (R&amp;M) case. ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 does not place requirements on the quality
    of the contents of an assurance case and does not require the use of a particular
    terminology or graphical representation. Likewise, it places no requirements on
    the means of physical implementation of the data, including no requirements for
    redundancy or co-location.
