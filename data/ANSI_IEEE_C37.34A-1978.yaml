abstract:
- content: Superseded. Procedures for corona testing of nonenclosed and enclosed switches
    with a rated maximum voltage of 121 kV and above are established. Test requirements
    and conditions are specified, and a test procedure is given. Simultaneous corona
    and radio-influence testing is addressed.
