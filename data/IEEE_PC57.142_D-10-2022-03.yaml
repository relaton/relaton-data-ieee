abstract:
- content: The performance of transformers in the presence of oscillatory transients
    is addressed in this guide. Oscillatory transients are typically produced by the
    interaction of the switching device, transformer, load, and system. This guide
    describes operating conditions that may produce oscillatory switching transient
    voltages damaging to the transformer insulation system. It discusses the electrical
    characteristics of the source, switching device, transformer, load, and the nature
    of their transient interaction. It discusses several mitigation methods. Two generic
    examples are included. This guide focuses on mechanical switching devices and
    does not address semiconductor switching devices.
