abstract:
- content: This standard is for a protection profile for hardcopy devices in a restrictive
    commercial information processing environment in which a relatively high level
    of document security, operational accountability, and information assurance are
    required. Typical information processed in this environment is trade secret, mission
    critical, or subject to legal and regulatory considerations such as for privacy
    or governance. This environment is not intended to support life-critical or national
    security applications. This environment will be known as "Operational Environment
    A".
