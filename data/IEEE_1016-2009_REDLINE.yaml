abstract:
- content: This standard describes software designs and establishes the information
    content and organization of a software design description (SDD). An SDD is a representation
    of a software design to be used for recording design information and communicating
    that design information to key design stakeholders. This standard is intended
    for use in design situations in which an explicit software design description
    is to be prepared. These situations include traditional software construction
    activities, when design leads to code, and reverse engineering situations when
    a design description is recovered from an existing implementation. This standard
    can be applied to commercial, scientific, or military software that runs on digital
    computers. Applicability is not restricted by the size, complexity, or criticality
    of the software. This standard can be applied to the description of high-level
    and detailed designs. This standard does not prescribe specific methodologies
    for design, configuration management, or quality assurance. This standard does
    not require the use of any particular design languages, but establishes requirements
    on the selection of design languages for use in an SDD. This standard can be applied
    to the preparation of SDDs captured as paper documents, automated databases, software
    development tools or other media.
