abstract:
- content: Practical test methods and techniques are presented for measuring the electrical
    characteristics of grounding systems. Topics addressed include safety considerations,
    measuring earth resistivity, measuring the power system frequency resistance or
    impedance of the ground system to remote earth, measuring the transient or surge
    impedance of the ground system to remote earth, measuring step and touch voltages,
    verifying the integrity of the grounding system, reviewing common methods for
    performing ground testing, reviewing instrumentation characteristics and limitations,
    and reviewing various factors that can distort test measurements.
