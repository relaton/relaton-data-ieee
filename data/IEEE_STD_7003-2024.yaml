abstract:
- content: 'The processes and methodologies to help users address issues of bias in
    the creation of algorithms are described in this standard. Elements include but
    are not limited to: criteria for the selection of validation data sets for bias
    quality control, guidelines on establishing and communicating the application
    boundaries for which the algorithm has been designed and validated to guard against
    unintended consequences arising from out-of-bound application of algorithms, and
    suggestions for user expectation management to help mitigate bias due to incorrect
    interpretation of systems outputs by users (e.g., correlation vs. causation).
