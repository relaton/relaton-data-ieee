abstract:
- content: 'IEEE previously adopted ISO/IEC 15288 as IEEE 15288:2005. ISO/IEC JTC
    1/SC 7 is now revising the document that we adopted. This project will permit
    IEEE to provide comments to the revision and adopt the result. The scope of the
    document is unchanged from the previous version: This International Standard establishes
    a common framework for describing the life cycle of systems created by humans.
    It defines a set of processes and associated terminology. These processes can
    be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system?s structure. Selected sets
    of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing and performing
    the stages of a system''s life cycle. This is accomplished through the involvement
    of all interested parties with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction.'
