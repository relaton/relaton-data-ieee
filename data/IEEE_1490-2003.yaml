abstract:
- content: 'Supersedes IEEE Std 1490-1998 SUMMARY: IEEE Std 1490-2003 is an adoption,
    in its entirety, of A Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK&#174;
    Guide). Project scope: The primary purpose of this document is to identify and
    describe that subset of the PMBOK that is generally accepted and adopt this as
    IEEE Std 1490-2002. Generally accepted means that the knowledge and practices
    described are applicable to most projects most of the time, and that there is
    widespread consensus about their value and usefulness. Generally accepted does
    not mean that the knowledge and practices described are or should be applied uniformly
    on all projects; the project management team is always responsible for determining
    what is appropriate for any given project. This document is also intended to provide
    a common lexicon within the profession for talking about project management. Project
    management is a relatively young profession, and while there is substantial commonality
    around what is done, there is relatively little commonality in the terms used.
    Footnote: Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and Project Management
    Institute (PMI) are registered as trademarks of the Project Management Institute,
    Inc. Project purpose: SESC has previously adopted the 1996 version of PMIBOK to
    provide a framework for software engineering project management. PMBOK 2000 added
    new material to reflect the growth of the knowledge and practices in the field
    of project management by capturing those practices, tools, techniques, and other
    relevant items that have become generally accepted. Additionally, clarification
    text and figures, and corrections, have been added that make the document more
    valuable to users. SESC intends to adopt the current version of PMBOK, replacing
    the previous version.'
