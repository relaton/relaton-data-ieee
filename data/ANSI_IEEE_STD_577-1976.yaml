abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to provide uniform, minimum acceptable
    requirements for the performance of reliability analyses for safety-related systems
    found in nuclear-power generating stations. The methods of this standard may also
    be applied to other systems including the interactions, if any, between safety-related
    and nonsafety-related system. The requirements can be applied during the phases
    of design, fabrication, testing, maintenance, and repair of systems and components
    in nuclear-power plants. The timing of the analysis depends upon the purpose for
    which the analysis is performed. This standard applies to the plant owner and
    other organizations responsible for these activities.<<ETX>>
