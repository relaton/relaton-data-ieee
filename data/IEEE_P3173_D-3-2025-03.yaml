abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the design of a hazard symbol for chemicals known
    or presumed to be endocrine disruptors, as well as those suspected of being endocrine
    disruptors. It includes example implementations for a range of potential use cases,
    such as labeling chemicals, electrical and mechanical components, consumer products,
    and hazardous areas. Additionally, it introduces a symbol to indicate the absence
    of endocrine disruptors, for optional use on products or to support awareness-building
    activities.
