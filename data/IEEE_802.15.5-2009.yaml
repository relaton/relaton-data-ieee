abstract:
- content: This IEEE recommended practice defines the architectural framework that
    enables WPAN devices to promote interoperable, stable, and scaleable wireless
    mesh topologies and, if needed, to provide the amendment text to the current WPAN
    standards that is required to implement this recommended practice.
