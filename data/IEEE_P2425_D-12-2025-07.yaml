abstract:
- content: 'This standard provides qualification methods and criteria to establish
    the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of equipment in nuclear power plants and
    other nuclear facilities. The methods and criteria incorporated in this standard
    apply to electrical and instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) equipment. EMC qualification
    involves two elements: 1) testing to assess susceptibility of equipment to interference
    levels that bound the expected electromagnetic environment at the installation
    site and 2) testing to assess emissions of equipment to help ensure that the contribution
    to the electromagnetic environment does not invalidate bounding interference levels
    applied for susceptibility testing.'
