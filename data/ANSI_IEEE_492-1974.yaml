abstract:
- content: General recommendations are provided for the operation, loading, and maintenance
    of hydro-generators and generator/motors (pump/turbines), having salient pole
    rotors and conventional cooling systems (as distinct from conductor cooling systems).
    The term hydro-generator refers to a generator driven by a hydraulic turbine or
    waterwheel. Types of units and bases of rating are included. Generators with cylindrical
    rotors are not covered.
