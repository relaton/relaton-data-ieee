abstract:
- content: This standard defines the air interface for radiating transceiver radio
    tags using long wavelength signals (kilometric and hectometric frequencies, &lt;450
    kHz). Conforming devices can have very low power consumption (a few microwatts
    on average), while operating over medium ranges (0.5 to 30 meters) and at low
    data transfer speeds (300-9600 bps). They are well suited for visibility networks,
    sensors, effectors and battery operated displays. This standard fills a gap between
    non-network-based RFID standards (e.g., ISO/IEC CD 15961-3, ISO 18000-6C or ISO
    18000-7) and existing high bandwidth network standards such as IEEE Std 802.11trade
    and IEEE 802.15.4trade.
