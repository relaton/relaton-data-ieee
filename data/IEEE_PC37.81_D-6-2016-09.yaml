abstract:
- content: This guide provides requirements and guidance for the seismic qualification
    of metal-enclosed power switchgear assemblies including switching, interrupting,
    control, instrumentation, metering, and protective and regulating devices mounted
    therein. As used in this guide, the word switchgear shall mean metal-enclosed
    power switchgear assemblies with the requirements as defined in IEEE Std C37.20.1,
    Standard for Metal-Enclosed Low-Voltage Power Circuit Breaker Switchgear, IEEE
    Std C37.20.2, Standard for Metal-Clad Switchgear, and IEEE Std C37.20.3, Standard
    for Metal-Enclosed Interrupter Switchgear. By definition, metal-enclosed power
    switchgear assemblies include metal-clad switchgear, metal-enclosed interrupter
    switchgear, and low-voltage power circuit breaker switchgear. This guide does
    not cover metal-enclosed bus or control switchboards.
