abstract:
- content: This standard defines the medium access control characteristics, physical
    layer interface methods and layer management parameters for the resilient packet
    ring (RPR) access method for ring topologies. A set of protocols for detecting
    and initializing the shared ring configuration, recovering from failures, and
    regulating fair access to the shared medium are also described. Specifications
    are provided for interface to a number of physical layers, supporting data rates
    up to 10 Gb/s. System considerations and management information base (MIB) specifications
    are also provided in this standard.
