abstract:
- content: The SystemC Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) extensions are defined in this standard.
    SystemC AMS is an ANSI standard C++ class library for electronic system-level
    design and modeling for use by system architects and engineers who need to address
    complex heterogeneous systems that are a hybrid between analog, digital and software
    components. This standard provides a precise and complete definition of the SystemC
    AMS class library so that a SystemC AMS implementation can be developed with reference
    to this standard alone. The primary audiences for this standard are the implementors
    of the SystemC AMS class library, the implementors of tools supporting the class
    library, and the users of the class library.
