abstract:
- content: This standard specifies an energy-efficient, rate 1 and modulation adaptive
    transmission system designed for the deployment of mixed line rates in optical
    networks. It introduces the transmission system and provides mechanisms to optimally
    configure the line rate to efficiently accommodate varying traffic loads while
    reducing the power consumption.
