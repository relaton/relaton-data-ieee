abstract:
- content: The fundamental principles, essential functions, and optional functions
    of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM) to make power electronic converters standardized
    for different applications and suitable for single-unit operation, multi-unit
    operation, islanded/off-grid operation, and grid-tied operation, facilitating
    the large-scale utilization of DER and the integration of power electronic converters
    into the grid, and advancing energy freedom and energy access are defined in this
    standard.
