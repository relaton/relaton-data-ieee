abstract:
- content: This standard provides a set of extensions to the IEEE 1364&#8482; Verilog&#174;
    hardware description language (HDL) to aid in the creation and verification of
    abstract architectural level models. It also includes design specification methods,
    embedded assertions language, testbench language including coverage and an assertions
    application programming interface (API), and a direct programming interface (DPI).
    This standard enables a productivity boost in design and validation and covers
    design, simulation, validation, and formal assertion-based verification flows.
