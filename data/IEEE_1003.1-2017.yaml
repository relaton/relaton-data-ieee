abstract:
- content: 'POSIX.1-2017 is simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 and The Open Group
    Standard Base Specifications, Issue 7. POSIX.1-2017 defines a standard operating
    system interface and environment, including a command interpreter (or “shell”),
    and common utility programs to support applications portability at the source
    code level. POSIX.1-2017 is intended to be used by both application developers
    and system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an associated
    volume): &#8226; General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes
    of this standard, including utility conventions and C-language header definitions,
    are included in the Base Definitions volume. &#8226; Definitions for system service
    functions and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming
    language, function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery,
    are included in the System Interfaces volume. &#8226; Definitions for a standard
    source code-level interface to command interpretation services (a “shell”) and
    common utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell and
    Utilities volume. &#8226; Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest
    of the document structure, which contains historical information concerning the
    contents of POSIX.1-201x and why features were included or discarded by the standard
    developers, is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume. The following areas
    are outside the scope of POSIX.1-201x: &#8226; Graphics interfaces &#8226; Database
    management system interfaces &#8226; Record I/O considerations &#8226; Object
    or binary code portability &#8226; System configuration and resource availability
    POSIX.1-2017 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of
    importance to application developers, rather than the internal construction techniques
    employed to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions
    and facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications.'
