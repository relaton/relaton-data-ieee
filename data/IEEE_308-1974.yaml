abstract:
- content: 'This standard applies to the electric systems in stationary single unit
    and multi-unit nuclear power generating stations that provide electric power to
    the Class IE equipment. The electric systems included are comprised of the following
    interrelated systems: (1)alternating-current power systems, (2) direct-current
    power systems, (3) vital instrumentation and control power systems. This standard
    also contains requirements for non-Class IE interfaces such as the preferred power
    supply. The purpose of this standard is to provide: the principal design criteria
    and the design features of the Class IE power systems that enable the systems
    to meet their functional requirement under the conditions produced by the applicable
    design basis events; and the requirements for surveillance of the class IE power
    system.'
