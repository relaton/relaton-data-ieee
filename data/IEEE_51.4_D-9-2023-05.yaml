abstract:
- content: This document describes an open standard for parts stress analysis and
    derating. It establishes uniform methods to increase a component’s reliability
    margin by decreasing the amount of applied stress (i.e., voltage, current, temperature,
    power, etc.) to an electronic, electrical, or electromechanical part. Reducing
    the stress levels improves device reliability/durability by reducing failure rates,
    thereby improving the reliability and availability of the product.
