abstract:
- content: This standard establishes electrical ratings and test requirements of cable
    joints usedwith extruded and laminated dielectric shielded cable rated in preferred
    voltage steps from 2500 Vto 500 000 V. It also defines a variety of common joint
    constructions. This standard is designed toprovide uniform testing procedures
    that can be used by manufacturers and users to evaluate theability of underground
    power cable joints to perform reliably in service.
