abstract:
- content: The basis for the coordination of equipment in unit substations by assisting
    in the selection of components is intended as the use of this guide. A variety
    of designs for unit substations are possible using various combinations of incoming
    sections, transformer sections, outgoing sections, and transition sections. It
    is intended that the incoming, outgoing, transformer, and transition sections
    included in a unit substation meet the basic requirements of applicable industry
    standards for those sections. This guide covers three-phase unit substations for
    step-down operation in the range of 112.5 kVA or greater at primary voltages of
    601 V through 52 kV.
