abstract:
- content: IEEE P1668 is a non-industry-specific trial use recommended practice for
    voltage sag and short interruption ride-through performance and compliance testing
    for all electrical and electronic equipment connected to low-voltage power systems
    that can experience malfunction or shutdown as a result of reductions in supply
    voltage lasting less than one minute. Testing procedures and requirements for
    test equipment are clearly defined within this document to reflect this electrical
    environment, including single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase balanced and unbalanced
    voltage sags. The recommended practice also defines requirements for certification
    and test reporting, including characterization of voltage-sag ride-through equipment.
