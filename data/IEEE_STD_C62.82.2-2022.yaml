abstract:
- content: The calculation method for selection of phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase
    insulation withstand voltages for equipment is presented. Methods for insulation
    coordination of different air-insulated systems like transmission lines and substations
    are outlined. The methods of analysis are illustrated by practical examples.
