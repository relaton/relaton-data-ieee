abstract:
- content: The recommended practices to solve the interface problem when applying
    industrial agents, namely, integrating intelligent software agents with low-level
    automation devices in the context of cyber-physical systems, are described in
    this recommended practice. In particular, a method to select the best interfacing
    practice for a given application scenario, defined by the user, from a set of
    available interfacing templates and technologies, aiming to improve reuse, consistency,
    and transparency in the integration of industrial agents and low-level control
    functions, is defined.
