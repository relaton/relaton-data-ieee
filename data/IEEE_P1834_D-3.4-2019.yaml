abstract:
- content: As a significant part of wind turbine, the rotor system of wind turbine
    has the functions of transforming wind energy, and balancing power, load and noise,
    it is critical to the wind turbine safety and economical operation. A rotor system
    consists of blade, hub, pitch system and yaw system. A technical supervision code
    for each part of the rotor system to improve the safety and normal operation is
    specified in this standard.
