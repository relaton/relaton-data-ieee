abstract:
- content: This recommended practice defines the areas of recommended knowledge for
    installers and maintainers of stationary batteries and related systems to the
    extent that they affect the battery. Design of the dc system and sizing of the
    dc battery charger(s) are beyond the scope of this document. This recommended
    practice covers only lead-acid and nickel-cadmium battery technologies. Its purpose
    is to provide an outline (not necessarily in training order) of the items that
    should be covered by training programs for stationary battery installation and
    maintenance personnel. The IEEE will not be certifying trained personnel nor providing
    its own battery technician training programs.
