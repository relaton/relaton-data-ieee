abstract:
- content: This part of the standard provides recommendations for summarizing the
    performance and theexpected uncertainty of the reflection coefficient of rectangular-waveguide
    apertures and interfaces for 110 GHz and above. The information provided also
    facilitates the development of a complete uncertainty analysis for the performance
    of rectangular waveguide interfaces. For example, it includes the dimensional
    information essential for calculating the uncertainty of both reflection and transmission
    coefficients through interfaces provided by different manufactures if both follow
    the recommendations of this Part 3 of the standard.
