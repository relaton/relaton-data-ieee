abstract:
- content: This document provides specifications for a high-speed serial bus which
    supports both asynchronous and isochronous communication and integrates well with
    most IEEE standard 32-bit and 64-bit parallel buses. It is intended to provide
    a low-cost interconnect between cards on the same backplane, cards on other backplanes,
    and external peripherals. Interfaces to longer-distance transmission media (such
    as UTP, optical fiber, and POF) allow the interconnection to be extended throughout
    a local network. This standard follows the IEEE Std 1212&#8482; -2001 Command
    and Status Register (CSR) architecture.
