abstract:
- content: An approach to preparing a specification for the thyristor bypass switch
    (TBS) of a unified power flow controller (UPFC) using modular multilevel converter
    (MMC) technology is documented by this guide. The intention of this guide is to
    serve as a base specification to allow users to modify or develop specific clauses
    to meet a particular application.
