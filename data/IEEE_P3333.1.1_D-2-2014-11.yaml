abstract:
- content: As the demand and supply for 3D technologies growing, the development of
    accurate quality assessment techniques shall be used to develop the industries
    of the 3D display devices and signal processing engines. This standard describes
    underlying principles and statistical characteristics of 3D contents based on
    human visual system (HVS). In addition, the reliable 3D subjective assessment
    methodology which covers the characteristics of human perception, display mechanism,
    viewing environment is introduced in this document.
