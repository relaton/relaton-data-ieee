abstract:
- content: 'The purposes of this Standard are: to document the minimum information
    that users of general-purpose laboratory cathode-ray oscilloscopes typically need;
    to provide potential purchasers and others with a common means for making comparisons
    between instruments; and to provide uniformity of information from manufacturers.
    This Standard applies primarily to general-purpose laboratory cathode-ray oscilloscopes;
    it does not necessarily apply to specific kinds of oscilloscopes, such as those
    employing sampling techniques, nor to storage oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers,
    television monitors, or other instruments using cathode-ray tube displays.<<ETX>>'
