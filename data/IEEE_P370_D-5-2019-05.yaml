abstract:
- content: 'This document provides standard and recommended practices for ensuring
    the quality of measured data for high frequency electrical interconnect at bandwidths
    up to 50 GHz. This might include but is not limited to: recommended design of
    test fixturing, methods and processes for ensuring the accuracy and consistency
    of measured data for broadband signals with frequency content up to 50 GHz. The
    standard and general practice should be applicable for frequencies higher than
    50 GHz as well. However, the highest applicable frequency is 50 GHz due to the
    lack of validation results above 50 GHz.'
