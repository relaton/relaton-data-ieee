abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std 1187-1996. This guide describes methods for selecting
    the appropriate type of valve-regulated, immobilized-electrolyte, recombinant
    lead-acid battery for any of a variety of stationary float applications. The purpose
    of this document is to ensure that the reader is aware of all significant issues
    that should be considered when selecting VRLA batteries, so that the user might
    make an informed decision.
