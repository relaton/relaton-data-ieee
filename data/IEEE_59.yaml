abstract:
- content: Describes the standardisation of measurement methods and procedures to
    enable the determination of a direction finder's (DF) characteristics which will
    permit analysis of DF performance in a uniform manner. Standard test conditions
    are given and test equipment is discussed. Direction finder sensitivity and system
    accuracy measurements are discussed, and time requirements and interference are
    considered.
