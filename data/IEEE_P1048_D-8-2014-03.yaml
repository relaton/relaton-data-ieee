abstract:
- content: This document provides guidelines for temporary protective grounding Temporary
    Protective Grounding (TPG) of electric power lines to protectassist in protection
    of workers from voltages and currents that might develop at a de-energized worksite
    during maintenance of AC overhead and underground, transmission and distribution
    lines, cables and equipment. Other forms of worker protection include isolation
    and insulation. These methods are described in other documents and guides and
    are not discussed here.
