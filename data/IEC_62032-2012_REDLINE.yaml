abstract:
- content: Theory, application of phase-shifting transformers, and the difference
    of specification and testing to standard system transformers are described in
    this guide. Various types of phase-shifting transformers and how to select the
    optimal design to achieve required control of power flow are covered. An understanding
    of the terminology, types, construction, and testing specific to phase-shifting
    transformers is provided.
