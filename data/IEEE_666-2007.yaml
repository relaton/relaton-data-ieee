abstract:
- content: This guide applies to station service systems that supply electric power
    to auxiliary loads for electric power generating stations. The discussions and
    recommendations in this guide provide the practices, criteria, and range of system
    parameters that relate to the service system requirements and assist in the application
    of existing engineering documents. This guide is not a handbook of design data;
    however, it explains what is good practice for the many different types of electric
    power service systems for generating stations.
