abstract:
- content: Guidance on technical protection measures to those who produce, use, process,
    or standardize the specifications of electronic design intellectual property (IP)
    are provided in this recommended practice. Distribution of IP creates a risk of
    unsanctioned use and dilution of the investment in its creation. The measures
    presented here include protection through encryption, specification, and management
    of use rights that have been granted by the producers of electronic designs, and
    methods for integrating license verification for granted rights.
