abstract:
- content: A set of tools is defined in this standard for efficient image coding,
    including tools for encoding, for decoding, and for encapsulation. Some of the
    tools are based on trained neural networks. These tools are designed to perform
    block partitioning, prediction, transform, quantization, entropy coding, filtering,
    and so on.
