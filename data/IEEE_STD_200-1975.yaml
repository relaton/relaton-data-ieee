abstract:
- content: 'The formulation and application of reference designations for electrical
    and electronics parts and equipment are covered. The reference designations of
    this standard are intended for uniquely identifying and locating discrete items
    on diagrams and in a set, as well as for correlating items in a set, graphic symbols
    on diagrams, and items in parts lists, circuit descriptions, and instructions.
    Three methods are given for forming and applying reference designations: the unit
    number method, the location numbering method, and the location coding method.
    A complete reference designation may incorporate reference designations formed
    by the use of any of these methods at any level from basic parts to complete units.'
