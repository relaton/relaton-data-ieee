abstract:
- content: This standard defines for Personal Health Devices (PHDs) and Point-of-Care
    Devices (PoCDs) a security baseline of application layer cybersecurity mitigation
    techniques for certain use cases or when certain criteria are met. The mitigation
    techniques are based on the extended Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
    (CIA) triad and are described generally to allow manufacturers to determine the
    most appropriate algorithms and implementations. A scalable information security
    toolbox appropriate for PHDs/PoCDs interfaces are specified, which fulfills the
    intersection of requirements and recommendations from the National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) and the European Network and Information Security
    Agency (ENISA). A mapping of this standard to the NIST Cybersecurity framework
    ISO/IEC 80001-2-2, and STRIDE classification scheme is defined.
