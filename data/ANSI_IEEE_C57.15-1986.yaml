abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C57 family on Power Distribution
    and Regulating Transformers. Electrical, mechanical, and safety requirements are
    set forth for step-voltage and induction-voltage regulators, single-phase and
    three-phase, oil-filled and dry-type, not exceeding 2500 kVA of regulation for
    three-phase units, or not exceeding 833 kVA of regulation for single-phase units.
    These provide a basis for the establishment of performance, limited electrical
    and mechanical interchangeability, and safety requirements of equipment described
    and for assistance in the proper selection of such equipment.
