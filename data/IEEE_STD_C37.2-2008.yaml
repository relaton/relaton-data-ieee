abstract:
- content: The definition and application of function numbers and acronyms for devices
    and functions used in electrical substations and generating plants and in installations
    of power utilization and conversion apparatus are covered. The purpose and use
    of the numbers and acronyms is discussed, and 95 numbers and 17 acronyms are assigned.
    Function numbers or function acronyms for arc fault detection, high impedance
    fault detection, human machine interface, communications devices, digital fault
    and sequence of event recorders, power quality recorders, substation time sources
    and synchrophasor devices are among those that have been added. The use of prefixes
    and suffixes to provide a more specific definition of a function is defined. Device
    contact designations are also covered.
