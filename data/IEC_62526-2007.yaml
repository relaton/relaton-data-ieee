abstract:
- content: Standard Test Interface Language (STIL) provides an interface between digital
    test generation tools and test equipment. Extensions to the test interface language
    (contained in this standard) are defined that (1) facilitate the use of the language
    in the design environment and (2) facilitate the use of the language for large
    designs encompassing subdesigns with reusable patterns.
