abstract:
- content: 'Cryptographic and data authentication procedures for storage devices that
    support length expansion, such as tape drives, are specified. Such procedures
    include the following cryptographic modes of operation for the AES block cipher:
    CCM, GCM, CBC-HMAC, and XTS-HMAC.'
