abstract:
- content: This standard applies to surge-protective devices designed for repeated
    limiting of voltage surges on 50 Hz or 60 Hz power circuits by passing surge discharge
    current and subsequently automatically interrupting the flow of follow current.
    This standard applies to devices for separate mounting and to those supplied integrally
    with other equipment.
