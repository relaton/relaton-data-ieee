abstract:
- content: The standard for the online monitoring and recording system of transient
    overvoltages in power system is used to regularize its methods, define the concrete
    structure of recording system for transient overvoltages and identify the requirements
    of capability checkout and uncertainty in online monitoring and recording systems.
