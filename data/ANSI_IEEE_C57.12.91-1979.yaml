abstract:
- content: Methods for performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.01-1989 and other
    referenced standards applicable to dry-type distribution and power transformers
    are described. This standard is intended for use as a basis for performance, safety,
    and the proper testing of dry-type distribution and power transformers. This standard
    applies to all dry-type transformers except instrument transformers, step-voltage
    and induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers,
    specialty transformers, and mine transformers.
