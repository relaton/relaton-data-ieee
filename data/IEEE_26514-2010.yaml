abstract:
- content: This standard provides requirements for the design and development of software
    user documentation as part of the life cycle processes. It defines the documentation
    process from the viewpoint of the documentation developer. It also covers the
    documentation product. It specifies the structure, content, and format for user
    documentation, and also provides informative guidance for user documentation style.
    It is independent of the software tools that may be used to produce documentation,
    and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation. Much of
    this standard is also applicable to user documentation for systems including hardware.
