abstract:
- content: This is a standard for definitions used for measurement of electric power
    quantities under sinusoidal, non-sinusoidal, balanced, or unbalanced conditions.
    It lists the mathematical expressions that were used in the past, as well as new
    expressions, and explains the features of the new definitions.
