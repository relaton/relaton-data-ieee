abstract:
- content: Recommendations are given for reactors intended for series connection,
    in both transmission and distribution systems, to control power flow under steady-state
    conditions and/or limit fault current under short-circuit conditions. Dry-type
    air-core reactors covered by this standard are self-cooled by natural air convection.
    With some restrictions, other reactors, including filter reactors, shunt capacitor
    reactors (used with shunt capacitor banks), and discharge current-limiting reactors
    (used with series capacitor banks) are also covered.
