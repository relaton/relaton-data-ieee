abstract:
- content: Installation design, installation, maintenance and testing procedures,
    and test schedules that can be used to optimize the life and performance of vented
    nickel-cadmium batteries used for continuous-float operations are provided. Guidance
    for determining when these batteries should be replaced is also provided. This
    recommended practice is applicable to all stationary applications. However, specific
    applications, such as alternative energy, emergency lighting units, and semiportable
    equipment, may have other appropriate practices and are beyond the scope of this
    recommended practice. Sizing, qualification, other battery types, and battery
    application are beyond the scope of this recommended practice.
