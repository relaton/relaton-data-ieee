abstract:
- content: Procedures and calculations necessary to apply the standard transient recovery
    voltage (TRV) ratings for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V
    and on a symmetrical current basis are covered. The capability limits of these
    circuit breakers are determined to a great degree by the TRV. TRV ratings are
    compared with typical system TRV duties.
