abstract:
- content: Protective relay applications involving electric service to consumers that
    requires a transformation between the utilitys supply voltage and the consumers
    utilization voltage are covered in this guide. This guide describes the factors
    that need to be considered in the design of adequate protection facilities, outlines
    modern relay practices, and provides several examples of the protection of typical
    utility-consumer interconnections.
