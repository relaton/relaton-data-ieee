abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of this standard is to provide minimum design requirements
    for supporting structures types to provide support of overhead contact systems
    for electrified transit. This standard is developed to govern the design and fabrication
    of supporting structures for OCS. It is provided to define minimum general design
    and construction parameters for the following tubular steel pole types: tapered
    and constant diameter round, tapered and constant diameter multi-sided, sectionaland
    fluted.'
