abstract:
- content: Test results and general performance of electrical apparatus, conductors
    and materials frequently are influenced by conditions such as Temperature, Pressure,
    Altitude, Density and Humidity of the surrounding air or other medium. For comparative
    results, it is necessary to standardize the conditions under which tests are made
    or to which test results are corrected. This pamphlet serves as a guide in the
    preparation or revision of standards for apparatus or materials of specific types
    or fields of use. If a particular existing standard calls for other provisions,
    the existing standard should be followed. The values given are not mandatory,
    but are recommended for use in preference to other values unless there are good
    technical or economic reasons for using others. The values recommended have in
    general been selected to agree with well-established practices. Provisions are
    made for a great variety of conditions and for widely different apparatus and
    materials, some of which may be of practical importance only under unusual circumstances.
    In any individual standard, only those quantities of real practical importance
    in the particular case should be used. When ranges are suggested, it is generally
    with the thought that acceptance tests may be made within that range. Tests may
    be made outside the range, if acceptable, and agreed upon correction factors are
    available. Preferred Numbers are suggested in many cases where there is no established
    practice.
