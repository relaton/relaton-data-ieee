abstract:
- content: Port-based network access control allows a network administrator to restrict
    the use of IEEE 802(R) LAN service access points (ports) to secure communication
    between authenticated and authorized devices. This standard specifies a common
    architecture, functional elements, and protocols that support mutual authentication
    between the clients of ports attached to the same LAN and that secure communication
    between the ports, including the media access method independent protocols that
    are used to discover and establish the security associations used by IEEE 802.1AE(TM)
    MAC Security.
