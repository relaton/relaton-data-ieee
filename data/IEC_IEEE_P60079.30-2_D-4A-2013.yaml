abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 60079 provides guidance for the application of electrical
    resistance trace heating systems in areas where explosive gas atmospheres may
    be present, with the exception of those classified as zone 0. It provides recommendations
    for the design, installation, maintenance and repair of trace heating equipment
    and associated control and monitoring equipment. It does not cover devices that
    operate by induction heating, skin effect heating or direct pipeline heating,
    nor those intended for stress relieving. This part supplements the requirements
    specified in IEC 60079-30-1.
