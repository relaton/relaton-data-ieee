abstract:
- content: Control architecture for high-power electronics from power semiconductor
    device levels to the power system level is defined and characterized. Coverage
    includes the application of power electronics in the areas of Power Quality/Custom
    Power, Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS), High Voltage DC Transmission
    (HVDC), Distributed Generation, Energy Storage applications, etc. with a power
    range from hundreds of kW to thousands of MW, but with emphasis on the 1 MW to
    hundreds of MW.
