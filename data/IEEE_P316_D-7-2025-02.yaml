abstract:
- content: The dc instrument shunts within this standard apply to shunts for use in
    direct current circuits to extend the current measuring range of devices (e.g.
    instruments, meters, protective relays, or low-voltage trip systems). The design
    and test principles within this standard may be applied with suitable exceptions
    for shunts constructed for special requirements; for example, those having unusually
    high or low current ratings or voltage drops, special or unusual ranges, and nonstandard
    terminal arrangements for special applications.
