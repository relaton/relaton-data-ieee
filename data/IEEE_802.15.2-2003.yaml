abstract:
- content: This recommended practice addresses the issue of coexistence of wireless
    local area networks and wireless personal area networks. These wireless networks
    often operate in the same unlicensed band. This recommended practice describes
    coexistence mechanisms that can be used to facilitate coexistence of wireless
    local area networks (i.e., IEEE Std 802.11b-1999) and wireless personal area networks
    (i.e., IEEE Std 802.15.1-2002).
