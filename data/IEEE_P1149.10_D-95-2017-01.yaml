abstract:
- content: Circuitry that may be built into an integrated circuit to assist in the
    test, maintenance and support of assembled printed circuit boards, assembled multi-die
    packages and the test of die internal circuits is defined. The circuitry includes
    a high-speed TAP (HSTAP) with a packet encoder/decoder and distribution architecture
    through which instructions and test data are communicated. The standard leverages
    the languages of IEEE Std. 1149.1 in order to describe and operate the on-chip
    circuits.
