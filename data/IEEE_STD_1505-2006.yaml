abstract:
- content: The scope of this document is the development of a common receiver/fixture
    interface (RFI) specification that is based upon available commercial standards
    integrated under a common "open" architecture. This mechanical/electrical interface
    is intended to serve government/commercial interest for applications in test,
    system integration, manufacturing, monitoring, and other functional requirements
    that demand large contact densities and quick-disconnect mechanical operation.

- content: 'A mechanical and electrical specification for implementing a common interoperable
    mechanical quick-disconnect interconnect system for use by industry for interfacing
    large numbers of electrical signals (digital, analog, RF, power, etc.) is provided.
    These large interface panels (receiver and fixture panels) are employed primarily
    in test systems between stimulus/measurement assets and a related unit-under-test
    (UUT), although any application involving high-density contacts requiring a quick
    disconnect interface could benefit. The receiver is a receptacle that is mounted
    to test system mates with multiple fixtures, which serve as the buffer between
    the UUT and automatic test equipment (ATE). Fixtures translate standard input/output
    (I/O) signal routing offered at the receiver to a wiring interface that directly
    connects to the UUT. These UUT interfaces can represent cable connectors, direct
    plug-in (printed circuit board edge connectors), sensor monitoring, or manual
    feedback from the test technician. The primary objectives of this standard are:
    (a) to establish interface standards that permit interchangeability of mechanical/electrical
    receiver/fixture/connector product assemblies from various manufacturers under
    an open architecture; and (b) to develop within this framework a defined set(s)
    of interconnecting connector and mechanical specifications that supports available,
    accepted, low-cost commercial technology to reduced dependence on proprietary
    designs and extend life-cycle availability.'
