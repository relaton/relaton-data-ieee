abstract:
- content: Guidance for providing products that satisfy the customer is given. This
    standard guides suppliers in planning a reliability program that suits their design
    philosophy, the product concept and the resources at their disposal, so that every
    activity adds value. This standard encourages suppliers and customers to cooperatively
    integrate their reliability processes. Requirements are written to properly establish
    the contractual or obligatory relationship between the supplier and customer in
    a product program.
