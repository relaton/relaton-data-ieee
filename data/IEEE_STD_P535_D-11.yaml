abstract:
- content: This document describes qualification methods for Class 1E lead storage
    batteries and racks to be used in nuclear power generating stations outside of
    primary containment. Qualification required in IEEE Std. 308- 1991 can be demonstrated
    by using the procedures provided in this standard in accordance with IEEE Std.
    323-1983 (R1996).
