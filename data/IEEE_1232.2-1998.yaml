abstract:
- content: Formal software interfaces to system diagnosis tools and applications are
    defined. As part of the AI-ESTATE set of standards, this standard defines services
    to manipulate information models as defined in IEEE Std 1232.1-1997 and to control
    a diagnostic reasoner. This standard includes a new information model to manipulate
    dynamic information obtained during the process of system diagnosis. Service bindings
    to ANSI C and ANSI Ada are also provided.
