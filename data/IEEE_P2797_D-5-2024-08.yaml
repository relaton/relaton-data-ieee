abstract:
- content: This guide is applicable to The prediction and early warning of icing on
    overhead transmission lines (OHLs) in micro-topographic areas is covered in this
    guide. Criteria for identifying micro-topographic areas and methods for predicting
    the icing thickness of OHLs is presented. This guide aims to provide guidelines
    for the observation, monitoring, prediction, early warning, and melting of ice
    on OHLs in micro-topographic areas, serving as references for anti-icing design
    and maintenance of OHLs in icing-prone areas.
