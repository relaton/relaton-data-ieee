abstract:
- content: This standard defines several use cases and services, namely, handover
    between heterogeneous networks, home energy management system, software-defined
    radio access networks, radio resource management and device-to-device communication
    service that need to be implemented in conjunction with the media independent
    services framework as specified in IEEE P802.21(TM)/D04-July2016
