abstract:
- content: A set of tools for efficient video coding, including directional intra
    prediction, variable block size inter prediction, context adaptive binary arithmetic
    coding, and the two corresponding decoding procedures, is defined in this standard.
    The target applications and services include, but are not limited to, UHDTV (ultra
    high definition TV), IP-based video surveillance, Internet video, IP-based video
    conference, IPTV, user-generated multimedia content, and other video/audio-enabled
    services and applications such as digital television broadcasting, digital storage
    media, and communication.
