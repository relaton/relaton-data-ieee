abstract:
- content: 'This Standard applies to all overhead, pad mounted, dry vault and submersible
    single or multi-pole alternating current automatic circuit reclosers and fault
    interrupters for rated maximum voltages above 1000 V and up to 38 kV. The following
    is also included in section 1: In order to simplify this standard where possible,
    the term recloser/FI (reclosers/FIs) has been substituted for automatic circuit
    recloser or fault interrupter or both. NOTE--When reclosers are applied in substation,
    special considerations may apply.'
