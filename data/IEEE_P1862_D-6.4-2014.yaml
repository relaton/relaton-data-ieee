abstract:
- content: This recommended practice specifies the procedure for selection of insulation
    levels of UHV AC transmission lines and substations. It also specifies reliability
    criterion under switching overvoltage and lightning overvoltage. It also suggests
    the calculation methods of insulation coordination design. According to the characteristics
    of UHV AC systems, overvoltages mitigation measures are recommended. Some examples
    of insulation coordination are presented.
