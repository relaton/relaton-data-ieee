abstract:
- content: Reliability data gathered from equipment reliability surveys and analyses
    over a period of 35 years or more is summarized in this collection. Equipment
    surveys conducted prior to 1976, detailed reports on the surveys and data collection
    efforts, and extensive lists of references on equipment reliability are presented.
    The collection provides the analyst with options for determining reliability parameters
    for older electrical systems.
