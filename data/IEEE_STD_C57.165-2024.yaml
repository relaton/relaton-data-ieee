abstract:
- content: The function and life expectancy of a transformer or reactor are directly
    related to the temperatures experienced by its components and structures. While
    temperature control schemes and data-gathering activities may be employed in an
    effort to keep temperatures within favorable levels, the accurate and timely measurement
    of temperature must be achieved before any controls or gathering of data can be
    effective. At the center of a transformer’s thermal performance is winding temperature.
    It is the primary factor that drives thermal activity in every other structure
    and material in the transformer. Thus, this topic is well covered in this guide.
    Other structures, such as ties, taps, and bushings, do produce some local heat
    and are also topics that are discussed. Thermal modifying elements such as insulating
    liquid, fans, and pumps are discussed but only insofar as temperature measurements
    are affected by them. The temperature of the ultimate heat sink, typically air,
    water, or some other liquid, is particularly important, since the effective removal
    of the heat produced by the windings is predicated on efficient transfer of heat
    energy to a lower energy mass. To help ensure temperature-moderating functions
    are being properly performed by auxiliaries such as fans and pumps, measurements
    of motor temperatures or motor current are sometimes employed. All of these topics
    are discussed along with recommended equipment for and methods of making accurate
    and timely temperature measurements.
