abstract:
- content: An ECMAScript application programming interface (API) for content-to-runtime-services
    communication is described in this standard. It is based on a current industry
    practice called “CMI--computer managed instruction.” This API enables the communication
    of information between content and a runtime service (RTS) typically provided
    by a learning management system (LMS) via common API services using the ECMAScript
    language. The purpose of this standard is to build consensus around, resolve ambiguities,
    and correct defects in existing specifications for an ECMA¬Script API for exchanging
    data between learning-related content and an LMS.
