abstract:
- content: The Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) that can improve interoperability,
    reduce the cost of using intellectual property (IP) for new projects or electronic
    design automation (EDA) tools, and make it easier to reuse verification components
    is provided. Overall, using this standard will lower verification costs and improve
    design quality throughout the industry. The primary audiences for this standard
    are the implementors of the UVM base class library, the implementors of tools
    supporting the UVM base class library, and the users of the UVM base class library.
