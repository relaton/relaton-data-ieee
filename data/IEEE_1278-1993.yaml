abstract:
- content: Superseded. Revision was redesignated 1278.1. Data messages, called protocol
    data units (PDUs), that are exchanged between simulation applications are defined.
    These PDUs provide information concerning simulated entity states and the types
    of entity interactions that take place in a distributed interactive simulation
    (DIS). The messages defined are for interactions that are primarily within visual
    range. Future versions of this standard will contain additional PDUs required
    to exchange information about interactions and functions not currently supported.
