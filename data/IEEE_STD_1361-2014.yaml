abstract:
- content: This guide is applicable to all stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems where
    PV is the only charging source. Stand-alone PV system parameters and operating
    conditions are discussed in relation to battery characteristics and expected system
    performance. Charging parameters for PV systems are suggested to help in the selection
    of a battery for a specific application. Finally, a performance test to verify
    the battery selection and system parameters is provided, including discussions
    on how to interpret test results. Test results only provide information on initial
    battery performance. No cycle-life predictions are made.
