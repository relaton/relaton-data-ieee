abstract:
- content: A flexible Optical Service Unit (OSU) path layer is specified by this standard
    for optical networks, providing services ranging from 2 Mb/s to 100 Gb/s. The
    main features of the OSU path layer are being offered in the form of massive OSU
    connections that carry packet and Constant Bit Rate (CBR) services with guaranteed
    performance, enabling the flexible hitless bandwidth adjustment (e.g. n × 10 Mb/s)
    for each OSU connection, along with capabilities such as high bandwidth efficiency,
    large capacity, and low latency. The OSU path layer can be carried on different
    server layers, for instance, OTN, PON, among others. The standard supports high-quality
    leased line services and video services, with guaranteed performance, that are
    utilized in telecom operator’s optical networks and other industry transport networks.
