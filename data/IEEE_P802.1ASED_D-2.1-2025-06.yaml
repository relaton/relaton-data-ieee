abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1AS™-2020 specifies protocols, processes,
    procedures, functions, mechanisms, and managed objects to enable fault-tolerant
    timing by increasing the availability of the time and adding time integrity. This
    is achieved using two or more generalized Precision Time Protocol (gPTP) domains,
    multiple time distribution paths, the local oscillator clock, and a time selection
    function with individual processes for times that have interdependencies and times
    that do not have interdependencies. Fault-tolerant timing includes fault-tolerant
    time generation and distribution.
