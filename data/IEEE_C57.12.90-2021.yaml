abstract:
- content: Methods for performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.00(TM) and other
    standards applicable to liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers
    are described. Instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators,
    arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding
    transformers, and mine transformers are excluded. Resistance measurements, polarity
    and phase-relation tests, ratio tests, no-load loss and excitation current measurements,
    impedance and load loss measurements, dielectric tests, temperature tests, short-circuit
    tests, audible sound level measurements, and calculated data are covered in this
    standard.
