abstract:
- content: This standard defines profiles that select features, options, configurations,
    defaults, protocols, and procedures of bridges, stations, and LANs that are necessary
    to build networks that are capable of transporting fronthaul streams, which are
    time sensitive. (The PDF of this standard is available at not cost compliments
