abstract:
- content: All liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers that
    are designed to operate at temperatures that exceed the normal thermal limits
    of IEEE C57.12.00TM under continuous load, in the designed average ambient, and
    at rated conditions are covered by this standard. Specific requirements and guidance
    in the design, testing, and application of the transformers covered within the
    scope of this standard are provided. High-temperature insulation systems or systems
    that use a combination of high-temperature and conventional insulation are incorporated
    by these transformers.
