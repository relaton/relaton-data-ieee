abstract:
- content: The self-management protocols for edge computing nodes are specified by
    this standard, including management protocols for achieve self-organization, self-configuration,
    self-recovery and self-discovery between multiple edge computing nodes. The management
    features for edge computing node cover node identification, hardware management,
    and software management.
