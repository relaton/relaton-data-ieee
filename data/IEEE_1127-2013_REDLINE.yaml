abstract:
- content: Significant community acceptance and environmental compatibility items
    to be considered during the planning and design phases, the construction period,
    and the operation of electric supply substations are identified, and ways to address
    these concerns to obtain community acceptance and environmental compatibility
    are documented. On-site generation and telecommunication facilities are not considered.
