abstract:
- content: Superseded by C37.011-1994. Transient recovery voltage requirements for
    AC high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V and on a symmetrical current
    basis are addressed. The effect of circuit parameters and the circuit breaker
    on the transient recovery voltage is considered, and transient recovery voltage
    tests are specified. Circuit breaker rating and application, calculation of transient
    recovery voltages, a short method of calculating TRV limits, and typical values
    of capacitance and its calculation for various equipment are covered.
