abstract:
- content: This standard specifies protocols among Service Composition (SC) Functional
    Entity (FE), Service Discovery and Negotiation (SDN) FE, Context Information Management
    (CIM) FE, Service Routing (SR) FE and Service Policy Decision (SPD) FE to support
    service composition capabilities in next generation service overlay network. The
    capabilities of service composition aim to support service chaining and instantiation,
    specification interpretation, service brokering and execution, and context-aware
    and dynamically adaptive service composition.
