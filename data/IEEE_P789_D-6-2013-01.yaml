abstract:
- content: The standard applies to wires and cables, used principally for power system
    communications and control purposes, which are located within electric supply
    locations or are installed within the zone of influence (ZOI) of the supply location
    ground potential rise (GPR), or which may be buried adjacent to electric power
    transmission and distribution lines. The standard covers the appropriate design
    requirements, electrical and mechanical parameters, the testing requirements,
    and the handling procedures for cables that are to be installed and operated in
    high voltage environments where they may be subjected to high voltages either
    by conduction, or inductive coupling, or both. Coaxial and fiber optic cables
    are specifically excluded from this standard except for those used in Ethernet
    applications. The objective of this standard is to provide information to assist
    in determining the electrical13 parameters of communication and control cables
    necessary to improve the overall reliability of these cables when used in high
    voltage environments. There should be a very high probability (greater than 99%)
    that these cables will perform their intended function for specified periods of
    time in high voltage interference conditions. The end result being more reliable
    communications over said cables. The information presented in this Standard will
    apply equally to either new or existing [already installed] cables.
