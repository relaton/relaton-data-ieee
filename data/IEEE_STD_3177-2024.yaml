abstract:
- content: The contents within this standard defines a modular framework for a robotically-assisted
    surgical system (RASS). The framework describes the hierarchical architecture,
    and presents the principles and specifications of the function module division
    and integration. A RASS is mainly divided into an execution module, perception
    module, human-machine interface module, image navigation/guidance module, planning
    and decision-making, safety and security module, and other modules.
