abstract:
- content: Information for understanding the construction, operation, and application
    of high-voltage (&#x003E; 1000 V) fuses and accessories, intended for use on alternating
    current (ac) electrical distribution systems is provided. Current-limiting, expulsion,
    electronic, and other non-current-limiting fuses and accessories are covered,
    as are North American, European, and other application practices.
