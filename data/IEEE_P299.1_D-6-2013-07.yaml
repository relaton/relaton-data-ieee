abstract:
- content: 'This standard provides uniform measurement procedures for determining
    the shielding effectiveness of electromagnetic (EM) shielding for a variety of
    enclosures and boxes having all dimensions between 0.1 and 2 meters in the radio
    frequency range not addressed by IEEE 299. This standard is divided into two parts:
    Part I - physically small, but electrically large enclosures and Part II - 0.75
    to 2 meters. In addition to a number of annexes aiding the measurement of shielding
    effectiveness of these enclosures, Annex J addresses physically small and electrically
    small enclosures, and Annex K addressed electrically small enclosures in reverberation
    chambers. Problems occurring in the testing of small enclosures, having linear
    dimension less than 2 meters, are very different from determining the shielding
    effectiveness of large rooms and broad depending of the actual size of the enclosure
    itself. A number of other annexes are included that address rationale, mathematical
    formulas, selection of measurement techniques, preliminary measurement and repairs,
    wall-mounted monopoles, impedance mismatch correction, and using isolated monopoles
    in outer reverberation chambers.'
