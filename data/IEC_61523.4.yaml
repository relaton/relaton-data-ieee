abstract:
- content: A method is provided for specifying power intent for an electronic design,
    for use inverification of the structure and behavior of the design in the context
    of a given power managementarchitecture, and for driving implementation of that
    power management architecture. The methodsupports incremental refinement of power
    intent specifications required for IP-based design flows.
