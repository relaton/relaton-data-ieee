abstract:
- content: The framework set out in this document is intended to help inform a range
    of stakeholders involved in various types of decision-making related to autonomous
    and intelligent systems (AIS), especially in the military context. The framework
    provides a granular means for identifying the technical considerations that are
    necessary to meet legal requirements, to inform and guide ethical discussions,
    and to determine human responsibility and accountability across the entire lifecycle
    of AIS
