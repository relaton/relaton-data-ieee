abstract:
- content: This document covers the grounding of dc equipment enclosures installed
    in dc traction power distribution facilities as well as related insulation treatments
    required for solid and resistance grounding methods. Guidelines are also given
    for material, installation, and testing of insulation used in dc traction facilities
    and further provides recommended criteria for acceptability. System grounding,
    though related, is not covered in this document.
