abstract:
- content: Standard requirements for all types of electrical control circuits for
    ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V are given. This standard is
    applicable for any type of power-operated mechanism and for both ac and dc control
    power. Only basic control elements of the circuit breaker, including reclosing
    where required, are included in this standard. Devices or circuits for protective
    relaying, special interlocking, etc., are not included.
