abstract:
- content: With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the performance
    of smart home devices has been significantly improved. With the boom in new products,
    the market is still lacking specifications and evaluation methods to assess product
    performance. Based on this, an evaluation system to judge the intelligence level
    of smart home devices from seven dimensions, including foundational capabilities,
    perception capabilities, cognition capabilities, motion capabilities, coordination
    capabilities, special skills, and security, has been constructed.
