abstract:
- content: The basic electrical parameters to be met by silicon PN junction voltage
    clamping components used for the protection of telecommunications equipment or
    lines from surges are defined in this standard. It is intended that this standard
    be used for the harmonization of existing or future specifications issued by PN
    diode surge protective component manufacturers, telecommunication equipment manufacturers,
    administrations, or network operators.
