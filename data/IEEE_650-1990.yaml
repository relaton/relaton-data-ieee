abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 650-2006. Methods for qualifying static battery
    chargers and inverters for Class 1E installations in a mild environment outside
    containment in nuclear power generating stations are described. The qualification
    methods set forth employ a combination of type testing and analysis, the latter
    including a justification of methods, theories, and assumptions used. These procedures
    meet the requirements of IEEE Std 323-1983, IEEE Standard for Qualifying Class
    1E Equipment for Nuclear Power Generating Stations.
