abstract:
- content: The electrical interfaces among the components comprising the auxiliary
    power systems and their electrical interface with other train-borne systems are
    described. As such, this standard treats the auxiliary power system components
    (e.g., static inverters and converters, low-voltage dc power supplies, back-up
    battery systems, and battery chargers) as black boxes and addresses only their
    interface requirements.
