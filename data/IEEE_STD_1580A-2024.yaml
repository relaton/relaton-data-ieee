abstract:
- content: With the recent and continued construction of offshore wind facilities,
    the industry needed a recommended practice for the cables to be used on the offshore
    wind electrical substations. Electrical cables used on offshore wind facilities
    are exposed to a similar environment as those historically used on shipboard and
    offshore facilities. The many years’ service of marine cable constructions covered
    by this document provide a solid basis for their use on offshore wind facilities.
