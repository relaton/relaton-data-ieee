abstract:
- content: This Local and Metropolitan Area Network standard, ISO/IEC 8802-5 :1992,
    is part of afamily of local area network (LAN) standards dealing with the physical
    and data link layers asdefined by the ISO Open System Interconnection Reference
    Model. Its purpose is to providecompatible interconnection of data processing
    equipment by means of a local area network usingthe token-passing ring access
    method. The frame format, including delimiters, addressing, andframe-check sequence,
    are defined, and medium access control (MAC) frames, timers, andpriority stacks
    are defined. The MAC protocol is defined. The finite-state machine and statetables
    are supplemented with a prose description of the algorithms. The physical layer
    (PHY)functions of symbol encoding and decoding, symbol time, and latency buffering
    are defined. Theservices provided by the MAC to the station management (SMT) and
    the services provided by thePHY to SMT and the MAC are described. These services
    are defined in terms of serviceprimitives and associated parameters. The 4 and
    16 Mb/s, shielded twisted pair attachment ofthestation to the medium, including
    the medium interface connector (MIC) are also defined. Theapplications environment
    for the LAN is intended to be commercial and light industrial. The useof token
    ring LANs in home and heavy industrial environments, while not precluded, has
    notbeen considered in the development of the standard. A Protocol Implementation
    ConformanceStatement (PICS) proforma is provided as an annex to the standard.
