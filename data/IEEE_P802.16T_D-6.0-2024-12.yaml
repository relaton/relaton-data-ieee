abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the air interface, including the medium access
    control layer (MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of combined fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint
    broadband wireless access (BWA) systems providing multiple services. The MAC is
    structured to support multiple PHY specifications, including WirelessMAN-SC, WirelessMAN-OFDM,
    and WirelessMAN-OFDMA PHY specifications, each suited to a particular operational
    environment.
