abstract:
- content: This guide for Centralized Protection and Control (CPC) systems within
    a substation addresses the realization of various protection, automation, and
    control functions within a CPC system utilizing data collected from intelligent
    electronic devices. This guide includes protection, automation, and control functions
    within a substation, including interconnecting circuits using devices and their
    interconnections with suitable communication protocols. This guide includes references
    to existing standards applicable to protection, automation, and control applications
    for various types of circuit elements such as generators, transformers, bus bars,
    shunt and series capacitor banks, reactors, transmission lines, and distribution
    lines. Some protection and control systems may be applied to protect the integrity
    of the power system, for example, to avoid cascading outages, equipment damage
    from unanticipated power system conditions beyond equipment emergency ratings,
    voltage collapse, angular instability, or other system problems. These systems
    are referred to as SIPS (system integrity protection schemes). The guide addresses
    CPC system architectures for typical substation configurations. The guide addresses
    the reliability and maintainability of each architecture, along with their respective
    testing requirements. The guide also addresses CPC-based system development, installation,
    commissioning, troubleshooting, and maintenance.
