abstract:
- content: Included in this amendment to IEEE Std 1900.6(TM) are procedures, protocols,
    and message format specifications for the exchange of sensing related data, control
    data, and configuration data between spectrum sensors and their clients. In addition,
    specifications for the exchange of sensing related and otherre relevant data and
    related interfaces between the data archive and otherre data sources have been
    added.
