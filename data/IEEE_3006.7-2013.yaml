abstract:
- content: Methods for determining the reliability of 7&#x00D7;24 continuous power
    systems in industrial and commercial facilities are described in this recommended
    practice. The method of reliability analysis by probability methods is described
    first. This is followed by a discussion of how to evaluate the results and how
    to implement changes to ensure that the expected degree of reliability is achieved.
