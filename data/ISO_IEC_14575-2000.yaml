abstract:
- content: Enabling the construction of high-performance, scalable, modular, parallel
    systems with low system integration cost is discussed. Complementary use of physical
    connectors and cables, electrical properties, and logical protocols for point-to-point
    serial scalable interconnect, operating at speeds of 10&#8211;200 Mb/s and at
    1 Gb/s in copper and optic technologies, is described.
