abstract:
- content: The interfaces between and among functional systems on rail rapid transit
    vehicles is prescribed. The systems themselves are treated as "black boxes;" requirements
    for the input signals and the output response are given. For each category of
    interface, three types are listed in in-creasing technical sophistication.
