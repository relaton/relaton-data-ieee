abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of power status communication between personal
    health devices (PHDs) and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal
    health appliances, and set-top boxes) is established by this standard in a manner
    that enables plug-and-play interoperability. Appropriate portions of existing
    standards are leveraged, including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models,
    application profile standards, and transport standards. The use of specific term
    codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality
    in base frameworks in favor of interoperability are specified. A common core of
    communication functionality for monitoring the power status of PHDs is defined
    in this standard.
