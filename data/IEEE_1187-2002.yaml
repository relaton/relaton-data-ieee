abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides guidance for the installation and installation
    designof valve-regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries. This recommended practice
    is intended for all float-service stationary installations. However, specific
    applications, such as emergency lighting units and semi-portable equipment, may
    have other appropriate practices and are beyond the scope ofthis recommended practice.
    Alternate energy applications are not covered.
