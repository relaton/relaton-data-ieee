abstract:
- content: These Marine Recommendations have been drawn up to serve as a guide for
    the equipment of merchant vessels with an electric plant system and electric apparatus
    for lighting, signaling, communication, power, and propulsion. They indicate what
    is considered good engineering practice with reference to safety of the personnel
    and of the ship itself as well as reliability and durability of the apparatus;
    it is not intended, however, that improvements, which may be developed from time
    to time, should be excluded. These Recommendations are intended to supplement
    the other Standards of the IEEE, which should be followed wherever applicable.
    Attention is directed to the fact that regulations for electric installations
    on shipboard are promulgated by the Government Regulatory Agencies and the American
    Bureau of Shipping. These Recommendations have given due consideration to all
    the regulations, but since the above referenced sponsoring bodies frequently modify
    the requirements to meet changing conditions, reference should always be made
    to the latest edition of their requirements.
