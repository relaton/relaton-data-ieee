abstract:
- content: This standard specifies an energy-efficient framework for video content
    distribution in IP over WDM networks. The framework considers delivering video
    content from fixed-size or variable size caches or from centralized or distributed
    video head-ends. To reduce the networking and caching power consumption, the framework
    optimizes the replacement of the caches content and the size of caches according
    to the content popularity changes throughout the day. Different test cases of
    an energy-efficient framework are presented and compared to video content delivery
    without caching.
