abstract:
- content: This amendment defines modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 medium access
    control layer (MAC) and physical layers (PHY). Compared to IEEE Std 802.11™-REVme,
    it enhances the Fine Timing Measurement protocol to make use of 320 MHz wide channels
    available with the IEEE 802.11be PHY and MAC.
