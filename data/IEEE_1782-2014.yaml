abstract:
- content: Reliability of electric power systems remains an important societal issue.
    While transmission disturbances draw national attention and scrutiny, service
    interruptions at the distribution level are the primary concern of the end-use
    customer and their regulatory and governmental representatives. Much effort has
    been expended in developing methods to uniformly and consistently quantify the
    reliability of distribution service based on electric system performance. However,
    the results of a nationwide survey of recorded information used for calculating
    distribution reliability indices performed in 1998 by the Working Group on System
    Design (now Distribution Reliability) indicate that significant inconsistencies
    exist in the data, categorization of that data, and in the collection processes
    used within the industry. This guide discusses the collection, categorization,
    and use of information related to electric power distribution interruption events
    and will be used in the development of industry guidelines. This guide presents
    a minimal set of data and a consistent categorization structure that, when used
    in combination with IEEE Std 1366(TM), will promote consistency in how the industry
    collects data for the purpose of benchmarking distribution system performance.
