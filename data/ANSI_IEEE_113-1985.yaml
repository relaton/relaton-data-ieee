abstract:
- content: 'Recommendations are made for conducting and reporting generally acceptable
    tests to determine the performance characteristics of conventional DC machines.
    Two categories of tests are provided: tests of dc motors and generators designed
    for essentially ripple-free operation, and tests of DC motors designed for use
    with rectifier power supplies. Electrical measurements and power sources for all
    test procedures are described. Preliminary tests, performance tests, temperature
    tests, and miscellaneous tests are covered.'
