abstract:
- content: ISO and IEEE 11073 standards enable communication between medical devices
    and external computer systems. This standard and corresponding IEEE 11073-104zz
    standards address a need for a simplified and optimized communication approach
    for personal health devices, which may or may not be regulated devices. These
    standards align with, and draw upon, the existing clinically focused standards
    to provide easy management of data from either a clinical or personal health device.
    This document addresses a need for an openly defined, independent standard for
    converting the collected information into an interoperable transmission format
    so the information can be exchanged between agents and managers.
