abstract:
- content: General considerations are presented for the electrical protection of telecommunication
    facilities serving electric supply locations. This document contains material
    which is common to the 487-family of Standards (i.e., dot-series) including fundamental
    protection theory, basic electrical protection philosophy, concepts and designs,
    protection apparatus; service types, reliability, service performance objective
    classifications, and transmission considerations. In general, special protective
    measures, handling procedures, and administrative procedures are necessary to
    provide electrical protection against damage to telecommunication facilities and
    equipment, maintain reliability of service and ensure the safety of personnel.
