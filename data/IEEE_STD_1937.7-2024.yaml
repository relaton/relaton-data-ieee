abstract:
- content: 'Polarimetric remote sensing is a new remote sensing observation method
    and a supplement to conventional remote sensing. It is effective at the ultraviolet,
    visible, and infrared spectral regions for improved monitoring of the Earth. Different
    objects have different polarized characteristics, and even different parts of
    the same objects show different polarization characteristics. As a result, at
    every band range (ultraviolet, visible, and infrared) polarimetric remote sensing
    requires different sensors, different band settings, different data preprocessing
    procedures, and even different recognition models for Earth objects. Multiple
    parameters and diverse metrics create interoperability and data utilization problems,
    unless standards are established in various aspects of polarimetric remote sensing
    for Earth observation systems. This standard’s contents specifies the basic definitions
    of terms in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Earth observation polarimetric remote
    sensing tasking as well as the basic processes and method from three aspects:
    data acquisition and preparation, data acquisition and correction, and data processing
    and application. Instructive suggestions in many specific dimensions are also
    provided, such as equipment status, parameter indicators, data calibration, and
    data processing methods. The contents mentioned within this standard will enable
    vendors to supply various components for UAV polarimetric remote sensing systems
    and contribute to interoperability in operations and data utilization of polarimetric
    remote sensing deployed in Earth observation systems.'
