abstract:
- content: Definition of the concept of modulation frequencies for LEDs; a discussion
    on their applications to LED lighting; a describe LED lighting applications in
    which modulation frequencies pose possible health risks to users are addressed
    in this recommended practice. A discussion on the concept of dimming of LEDs by
    modulating the frequency of driving currents/voltage and present recommendations
    for modulation frequencies (flicker) for LED lighting and dimming applications
    to help protect against known potential adverse health effects is also addressed.
