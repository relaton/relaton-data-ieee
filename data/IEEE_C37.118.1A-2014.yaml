abstract:
- content: Modifications in this amendment include some performance requirements with
    related text updates to correct inconsistencies and remove limitations introduced
    by IEEE Std C37.118.1(TM)-2011. It was discovered that a few requirements were
    not achievable with the published models as was intended and others were extremely
    difficult to meet with available hardware. This amendment modifies requirements
    in Table 4 through Table 10. Text was modified to support the requirement modification.
    Testing described in 5.5.9 was clarified, and Table 11 (formerly Table 12) was
    modified to match. Annex C was modified to keep it consistent with the rest of
    the document.
