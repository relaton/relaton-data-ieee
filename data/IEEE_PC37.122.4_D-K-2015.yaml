abstract:
- content: This project will provide guidance for the planning, permitting, design,
    equipment specification, installation, commissioning, operation, and maintenance
    of gas insulated transmission lines. The guide will address technical aspects
    only. Commercial and legal issues associated with gas insulated transmission lines
    are not considered. This guide applies to AC transmission lines rated for maximum
    operating voltage of 72.5 kV and higher.
