abstract:
- content: A conceptual data schema that defines the structure of a metadata instance
    for a learning object is specified in this standard. For this standard, a learning
    object is defined as any entity, digital or non-digital, that is used for learning,
    education, or training; a metadata instance for a learning object describes relevant
    characteristics of the learning object to which it applies. Such characteristics
    can be regrouped in general, life cycle, meta-metadata, educational, technical,
    educational, rights, relation, annotation, and classification categories. The
    conceptual data schema defined in this standard specifies the data elements of
    which a metadata instance for a learning object is composed and allows for linguistic
    diversity of both learning objects and the metadata instances that describe them.
    It is intended that this standard will be referenced by other standards that will
    define the implementation descriptions of the data schema, so that a metadata
    instance for a learning object can be used by a learning technology system to
    manage, locate, evaluate, or exchange learning objects. The intent of this standard
    is to specify a base schema, which can be used to build on as practice develops,
    for instance in order to facilitate automatic, adaptive scheduling of learning
    objects by software agents.
