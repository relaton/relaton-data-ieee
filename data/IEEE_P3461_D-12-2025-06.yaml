abstract:
- content: Smart infrastructure applications have used distributed fiber optic sensors
    to monitor strain, vibration, and temperature. IEEE standards exist for Bragg
    grating sensors and distributed acoustic sensors (DAS) The current standard activity
    will expand the monitoring capability to include overloading bridge capacity with
    heavy vehicles, the impact of corrosion, crack formation and growth in structural
    members, The purpose is to monitor structural health by changes in monitored parameters
    including strain and vibration signature and identify potential points of failure.
    While the impact of corrosion and cracked structures will be monitored, the scope
    of the activity does not include characterization of the fracture mechanics of
    the crack formation or chemistry associated with corrosion which typically requires
    a laboratory environment. In addition, the standard activity will address how
    these sensing systems interface with both wired and wireless local area networks
    and powering remote sensing systems. As previously stated, monitored infrastructure
    includes bridges, tunnels, dams, buildings, rail lines, power lines and pipelines.
