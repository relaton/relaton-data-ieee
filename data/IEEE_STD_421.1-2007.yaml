abstract:
- content: This standard defines elements and commonly used components in excitation
    systems and contains definitions for excitation systems applied to synchronous
    machines. An included annex contains one-line block diagrams of some typical excitation
    systems. These are presented to illustrate the defined terminology referenced
    in this standard and clarify the understanding of the excitation control system.

- content: 'This standard defines elements and commonly used components in excitation
    control systems and contains definitions for excitation systems as applied to
    synchronous machines. These definitions should be useful in the following areas:
    -- Writing excitation systems specifications -- Evaluating excitation system performance
    -- Specifying methods for excitation system tests -- Preparing related excitation
    system standards -- Serving as an educational means for those becoming acquainted
    with excitation systems -- Modeling excitation systems'
