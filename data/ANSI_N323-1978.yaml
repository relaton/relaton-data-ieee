abstract:
- content: Calibration methods for portable (hand-carried) radiation protection instruments
    used for detection and measurement of levels of ionizing radiation fields or levels
    of radioactive surface contamination are established. Included are conditions,
    equipment, and techniques for calibration as well as the degree of precision and
    accuracy required. Alpha, beta, photon, and neutron radiation is considered. Passive
    integrating dosimetric devices such as film, theremoluminescent, and chemical
    dosimeters are not covered, although the basic principles and intent may apply
    to them as well as to nonportable radiation detection instrumentation in general.
