abstract:
- content: Described in this document is the recommended use method of unmanned aerial
    vehicle (UAV) for substation inspection. The composition and technical conditions
    of a UAV inspection system, inspection objects and methods, inspection operation
    methods, inspection data processing, and UAV maintenance are introduced. This
    method is applicable to the use of UAVs that inspect and test substation equipment
    and the surrounding environment.
