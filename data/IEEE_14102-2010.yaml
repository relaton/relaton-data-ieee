abstract:
- content: This standard adopts ISO/IEC 14102:2008 and defines both a set of processes
    and a structured set of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tool characteristics
    for use in the technical evaluation and the ultimate selection of a CASE tool.
    It follows the software product evaluation model defined in ISO/IEC 14598-5:1998.
