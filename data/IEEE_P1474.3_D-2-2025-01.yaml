abstract:
- content: Communications-based train control (CBTC) system design and functional
    allocations from IEEE Std 1474.1-2025 are built upon in the recommended practice
    by decomposing each identified automatic train protection, automatic train operation,
    and automatic train supervision function to a level where each subfunction can
    be allocated to one of the CBTC subsystems.
