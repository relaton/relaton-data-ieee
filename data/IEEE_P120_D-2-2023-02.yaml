abstract:
- content: The material submitted for the 2020 reinstatement of Working Group 120
    is the basis for this updated version. To provide general guidelines intended
    to assist nonelectrical engineers and technicians involved in quality control,
    acceptance, and prototype testing where electrical instrumentation is the main
    tool for measuring, observing, or recording physical quantities is the basic approach
    for the new organization. The contributors strived to maintain the relevant and
    important knowledge that was previously carefully collected and update this as
    appropriate.
