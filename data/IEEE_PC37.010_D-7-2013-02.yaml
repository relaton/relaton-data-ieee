abstract:
- content: This guide covers the application of indoor and outdoor high-voltage circuit
    breakers rated above 1000 V for use in commercial, industrial, and utility installations.
    It deals with usage under varied service conditions, temperature conditions affecting
    continuous current compensation, reduced dielectrics, reclosing derating as applicable,
    calculation of system short5 circuit current, compensation at different X/R ratios,
    detailed calculations with application curves, out-of-phase switching, and general
    application
