abstract:
- content: 'This standard covers means of safeguarding personnel while operating equipment
    located in electrolytic cell line working zones. Included are related requirements
    for equipment and electrical conductor installations. The general types of DC
    electrolytic cells covered include, but are not limited to, the cells used in
    the production of aluminum, cadmium, chlorate, chlorine, copper, fluorine, hydrogen
    peroxide, magnesium, sodium, and zinc. This standard does not cover: electroplating
    and anodizing facilities; AC cells or furnaces; electrothermal process furnaces;
    arc furnaces; melting or heat treating facilities; Any electrical equipment that
    is neither part of the electrolytic process equipment nor installed or used in
    the cell line working zone Items referred to in are not covered by this standard
    and shall be installed in accordance with NFPA 70-1975, National Electrical Code
    (ANSI C1-1975), or the latest revision thereof.'
