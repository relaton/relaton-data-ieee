abstract:
- content: This standard describes certain electrical and mechanical characteristics
    and takes into consideration certain safety features of 60-Hz, two-winding, ventilated
    dry-type transformers with self-cooled ratings 1 to 500 kVA, single-phase, and
    15 to 500 kVA, three-phase, inclusive; high-voltage 601 to 34 500 volts, and low-voltage
    120 to 600 volts, inclusive; generally used for step-down purposes. (Forced-air-cooled
    ratings for certain sizes are listed in Part II.)
