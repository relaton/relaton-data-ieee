abstract:
- content: Methods of testing and evaluating dissolved gases in mineral based transformer
    oils found in Load Tap Changers (LTCs) are discussed and recommended in this guide.
    General types of LTC mechanisms, breathing configurations and electrical design
    are included as evaluation criteria for determining when mechanical damage or
    failure has occurred. Dissolved Gas of the LTC is required. This guide is not
    manufacturer specific, rather category specific.
