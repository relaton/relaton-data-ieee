abstract:
- content: Changes to clarify how and when to encrypt header and payload information
    elements, update the interleaver design in order to eliminate some drawbacks in
    certain channels, a new PHY data primitive attribute so sub-band SNR data can
    be obtained from the PHY, modification to the frame counter size for security
    to make it consistent with IEEE Std 802.15.4e(TM)-2012, and adding a beacon attribute
    and change the zero crossing detector text are addressed in this amendment.
