abstract:
- content: This document provides design process guidance f 1 or developing computer-based
    graphical user interface (GUI) displays, including their form and function. This
    guidance applies to GUI display systems provided with new nuclear power generating
    stations and other nuclear facilities, or as digital upgrades to existing facilities,
    including monitoring and controls systems. The scope ranges from small modular
    panel inserts limited to single systems through multiple workstations intended
    to monitor and / or control the entire nuclear facility. The guidance applies
    for displays used within or outside of the main control room (MCR). This guidance
    does not cover the technical details found in IEEE Std 1289.
