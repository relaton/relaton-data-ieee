- content: Revision of IEEE Std 382-1996 Direction for the implementation of the requirements
    of IEEE Std 323TM-2003 as they apply to the specific features of safety-related
    actuator qualification are provided. This standard establishes criteria for qualification
    of safety-related actuators, and actuator components, in Nuclear Power Generating
    Stations in order to demonstrate their ability to perform their intended safety
    functions under all required conditions.
