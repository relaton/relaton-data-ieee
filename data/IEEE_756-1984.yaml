abstract:
- content: This guide covers general recommendations for loading mineral-oil-immersed
    power transformers manufactured in accordance with ANSI/IEEE C57.12.00-1980 [1]
    1 and having a maximum nameplate rating in excess of 100 MVA (three phase) or
    333 MVA (single phase). Such transformers have an average winding rise of 65 &#x00B0;C
    maximum and a hottest-spot rise of 80 &#x00B0;C maximum at rated load.
