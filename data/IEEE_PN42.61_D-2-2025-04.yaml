abstract:
- content: The IEEE N42.61 standard specifies the notation of radiation data and some
    non-radiation data that is streamed in real-time from a radiation detection instrument
    to a receiving device. The data is intended to be streamed wirelessly, but can
    be also transmitted by cable. The transmission protocol is not part of the standard,
    although some general transmission rules recommendations are provided. The subsequent
    display, processing, and analysis of the radiation data on the receiving device
    are outside the scope of this standard. The radiation data consist mainly of raw
    or unprocessed data, and include dosimetric data, and non-radiation data such
    as the status of the instrument and its sensors and detectors (e.g., temperature,
    remaining battery charge, voltage).
