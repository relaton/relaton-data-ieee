abstract:
- content: Goals for the design of electrical systems that include both linear and
    nonlinear loads are established in this recommended practice. The voltage and
    current waveforms that may exist throughout the system are described, and waveform
    distortion goals for the system designer are established. The interface between
    sources and loads is described as the point of common coupling and observance
    of the design goals will reduce interference between electrical equipment.This
    recommended practice addresses steady-state limitations. Transient conditions
    exceeding these limitations may be encountered. This document sets the quality
    of power that is to be provided at the point of common coupling. This document
    does not cover the effects of radio-frequency interference; however, guidance
    is offered for wired telephone systems.
