abstract:
- content: Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are covered
    in this standard, and certain safety features of single-phase, 60 Hz, mineral-oil-immersed,
    self-cooled, pad-mounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers are taken
    into consideration. These transformers are rated 167 kVA and smaller, with high
    voltages of 34 500 GrdY/19 920 V and below, and with low voltages of 240/120 V.
    These transformers are generally used for step-down purposes from an underground
    primary cable supply. The connector, bushing and terminal arrangements for radial
    or loop feed systems are covered in this standard. The electrical and mechanical
    requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer
    are not covered in this standard.
