abstract:
- content: 'This standard specifies cryptographic and data authentication procedures
    for storage devices that support length-expansion, such as tape drives. Such procedures
    include the following cryptographic modes of operation for the AES block cipher:
    CCM, GCM, CBC-HMAC, and XTS-HMAC.'
