abstract:
- content: This standard defines five types of software reviews and audits, together
    with procedures required for the execution of each type. This standard is concerned
    only with the reviews and audits; it does not define procedures for determining
    the necessity of a review or audit, nor does it specify the disposition of the
    results of the review or audit. Types include management reviews, technical reviews,
    inspections, walk-throughs, and audits.
