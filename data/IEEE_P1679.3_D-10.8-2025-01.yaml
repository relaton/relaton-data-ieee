abstract:
- content: Guidance for an objective evaluation of flow batteries by a potential user
    for any stationary application is provided in this document. IEEE Std 1679™-2020
    is to be used in conjunction with this document. In a flow battery, the electrolyte
    is stored in one or two tanks, and pumps are utilized to deliver the electrolyte
    through the cells in order to recharge or discharge the battery. (When two electrolytes
    are used, they are often referred to as negolyte and posolyte). Technology descriptions,
    operating parameters, failure modes, safety information, battery architecture,
    and qualification and application considerations are provided in this document.
    Batteries that do not employ flowing electrolyte systems are not covered. Sizing,
    installation, maintenance, and testing techniques are not covered except insofar
    as they may influence the evaluation of a flow battery for its intended application.
