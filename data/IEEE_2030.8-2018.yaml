abstract:
- content: A set of testing procedures that enable verification, quantification of
    performance, and comparison of the performance with expected minimum requirements
    of the different functions of the microgrid controller are developed in this standard.
    The functions tested are microgrid controller functions that are common to the
    control of all microgrids regardless of topology, configuration, or jurisdiction.
    It aims to present metrics for a comparison of the control functions required
    from both the microgrid operator and the Distribution System Operator (DSO). This
    standard is functionalitydriven and focuses on a modular approach to the implementation
    of the functional requirements.
