abstract:
- content: This pamphlet serves as a guide in the preparation or revision of standards
    for apparatus or materials of specific types or fields of use. If a particular
    existing standard calls for other provisions, the existing standard should be
    followed. The values given are not mandatory, but are recommended for use in preference
    to other values unless there are good technical or economic reasons for using
    others. The values recommended have in general been selected to agree with well-established
    practices. Provisions are made for a great variety of conditions and for widely
    different apparatus and materials, some of which may be of practical importance
    only under unusual circumstances. In any individual standard, only those quantities
    of real practical importance in the particular case should be used. When ranges
    are suggested, it is generally with the thought that acceptance tests may be made
    within that range. Tests may be made outside the range, if acceptable, and agreed
    upon correction factors are available.
