abstract:
- content: A method for properly sizing the PV array and battery for stand-alone PV
    systems where PV is the only charging source is recommended (in conjunction with
    IEEE Std 1013<sup>TM</sup>). Load calculations and determination of solar radiation
    in the sizing of the system need special attention. Additionally, the critical
    nature of the load in deciding an acceptable annual availability needs to be considered.
