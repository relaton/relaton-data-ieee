abstract:
- content: This standard pertains to the requirements for current and voltage protective
    functions of:1) direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices2) direct-acting
    overcurrent electronic trip systems3) reverse-current trip systems4) undervoltage
    trip devicesthat are integral with low-voltage ac (635V and below) and general
    purpose low-voltage dc (600V and below) power circuit breakers covered by IEEE
    Std C37.13(TM), IEEE Std C37.14(TM), and IEEE Std C37.16(TM).Additional information,
    communication and/or additional internal or external protective functions or devices
    are not covered by this standard. This standard should not be interpreted to restrict
    theinclusion of such functionality in the device.
