- content: The terms and definitions in the standard are intended to encompass the
    products within the scope of ac (38kV and below for air insulated equipment, 52kV
    and below for gas insulated equipment) and dc (3.2 kV and below) power switchgear
    assemblies, including components for switching, interrupting, metering, protection,
    and regulating purposes as used primarily in connection with generation, transmission,
    distribution, and conversion of electric power.
