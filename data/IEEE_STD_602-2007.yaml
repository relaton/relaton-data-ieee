abstract:
- content: 'A recommended practice for the design and operation of electric systems
    in health care facilities is provided. The term health care facility as used here
    encompasses buildings or parts of buildings that contain hospitals, nursing homes,
    residential custodial care facilities, clinics, ambulatory health care centers,
    and medical and dental offices. Buildings or parts of buildings within an industrial
    or commercial complex, used as medical facilities, logically fall within the scope
    of this recommended practice. Remarks: Revision of IEEE Std 602-1996'
