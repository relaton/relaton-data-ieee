abstract:
- content: The SystemC<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) extensions are
    defined in this standard. SystemC AMS is an ANSI standard C++ class library for
    electronic system-level design and modeling for use by system architects and engineers
    who need to address complex heterogeneous systems that are a hybrid between analog,
    digital and software components. This standard provides a precise and complete
    definition of the SystemC AMS class library so that a SystemC AMS implementation
    can be developed with reference to this standard alone. The primary audiences
    for this standard are the implementors of the SystemC AMS class library, the implementors
    of tools supporting the class library, and the users of the class library.
