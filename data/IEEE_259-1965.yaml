abstract:
- content: The object of this Test Procedure is to establish a method for estimating
    by comparison the life expectancy of specialty transformer insulation systems
    under actual operating conditions. The electrical insulation of specialty transformers
    is made up of many different components selected to withstand the widely different
    electric, mechanical, and thermal stresses occurring in different parts of the
    structure. How long an insulation system will be serviceable depends on the effectiveness
    of the physical support for the insulation, and the severity of the forces acting
    on it, as well as on the materials themselves and the service environment. Therefore,
    the length of useful life of the insulation system will depend on the way that
    its individual components are arranged, their interactions upon each other, and
    the contribution of each component to the electrical and mechanical integrity
    of the system.
