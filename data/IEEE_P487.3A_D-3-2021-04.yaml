abstract:
- content: Safe and reliable methods for the electrical protection of telecommunication
    facilities serving electric supply locations through the use of metallic wire-line
    components in part of the telecommunication circuit, and optical fiber systems
    in the remainder of the telecommunication circuit are presented in this standard.
    Hybrid applications have an equipment junction between the metallic wire-line
    and the optical fiber cable, i.e., a wire-line--fiber cable junction (CFJ).
