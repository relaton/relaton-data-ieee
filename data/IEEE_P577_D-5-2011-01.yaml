abstract:
- content: This standard sets forth the minimum acceptable requirements for the performance
    of reliability analyses for safety systems when used to address the reliability
    considerations discussed in industry standards and guidelines. The requirement
    that a reliability analysis be performed does not originate with this standard.
    However, when reliability analysis is used to demonstrate compliance with reliability
    requirements, this standard describes an acceptable response to the requirements.
