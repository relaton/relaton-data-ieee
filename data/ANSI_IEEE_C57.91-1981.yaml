abstract:
- content: General recommendations for loading 65 degrees Centigrade-rise mineral-oil-immersed
    overhead and pad-mounted distribution transformers are covered. Recommendations
    for 55 degrees Centigrade-rise transformers are included because a substantial
    percentage of these transformers are still in service. The recommendations are
    based on winding hottest-spot calculations only. Other factors that may limit
    the permissible load to lower values are listed. A method to establish winding
    temperature and loss of life by nomographs is given.
