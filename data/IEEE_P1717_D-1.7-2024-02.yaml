abstract:
- content: Standardization of circuit integrity cable testing is beneficial to cable
    manufacturers, distributors, and users. Uniform procedures, consistent, repeatable
    results, and measurable test acceptance criteria are required to allow comparisons
    among competing products and to allow selection of the correct product for the
    application.
