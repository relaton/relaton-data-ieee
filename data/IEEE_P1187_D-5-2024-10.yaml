abstract:
- content: Guidance for the installation and installation design of valve-regulated
    lead-acid (VRLA) batteries is provided in this recommended practice. This recommended
    practice is intended for all standby stationary installations. However, specific
    applications, such as emergency lighting units and semi-portable equipment, may
    have other appropriate practices and are beyond the scope of this recommended
    practice. Alternative energy applications and systems exceeding 1000V are not
    covered.
