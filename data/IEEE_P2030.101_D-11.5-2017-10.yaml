abstract:
- content: The design, installation, and monitoring of time synchronization systems
    in power utility substations is covered. This includes time sources such as Global
    Positioning Satellite (GPS) and time distribution systems such as Inter-Range
    Instrumentation Group Format B (IRIG-B), Network Time Protocol (NTP) or Simple
    Network Time Protocol (SNTP), and IEEE Std C37.238™. The time source and the intelligent
    electronic device (IED) are assumed to have accurate clocks.
