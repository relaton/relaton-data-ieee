abstract:
- content: Surge protective components (SPCs) used in power and telecom surge protective
    devices (SPDs) and equipment ports are covered in the IEEE C62.42(TM) guide series.
    This part, Part 3 of the series, describes silicon PN-Junction clamping diode
    SPCs and covers technology variants, including forward biased semiconductor diodes,
    Zener breakdown semiconductor diodes, avalanche breakdown semiconductor diodes,
    punch-through semiconductor bipolar junction transistor diodes, and fold-back
    semiconductor bidirectional transistor diodes, as well as component construction;
    characteristics; ratings; and application examples.
