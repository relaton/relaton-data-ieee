abstract:
- content: The scope of this Recommended Practice will be to identify the means for
    timely and efficient exchange of information between manufacturers and users of
    protection related equipment with respect to (i) changes in device firmware and
    (ii) the impact of those changes. It will also include an examination of the technical
    and operational ramifications resulting from changes in the device firmware. Only
    hardware changes that impact firmware changes will be included.
