abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, the landscape of transport-independent applications and information
    profiles for personal telehealth devices is described in this guide. Defined in
    these profiles are data exchange, data representation, and terminology for communication
    between personal telehealth devices and compute engines (e.g., health appliances,
    set top boxes, cell phones, and personal computers). A definition of personal
    telehealth devices as devices used for life activity, wellness monitoring, and/or
    health monitoring in domestic home, communal home, and/or mobile applications
    is provided in this guide. Use cases relevant to these scenarios and environments
    are also presented.
