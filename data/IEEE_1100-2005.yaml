abstract:
- content: The IEEE Emerald Book(TM) presents a collection of consensus best practices
    for the powering and grounding of electronic equipment used in commercial and
    industrial applications.The main objective is to provide consensus recommended
    practices in an area where conflicting information and conflicting design philosophies
    have dominated. The recommended practices described are intended to enhance equipment
    performance while maintaining a safe installation. A description of the nature
    and origin of power disturbances is provided, followed by theory on the various
    parameters that impact power quality. Information on quantifying and resolving
    power and grounding related concerns using measurement and diagnostic instrumentation
    and standardized investigative procedures are included. Recommended power protection
    equipment and wiring and grounding system design practices are presented. Information
    on telecommunications system power protection as well as grounding, industrial
    system grounding, and noise control is included.Finally a selection of case studies
    are presented to support the recommended practices presented throughout the book.
