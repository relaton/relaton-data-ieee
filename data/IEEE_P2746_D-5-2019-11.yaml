abstract:
- content: This guide identifies the mechanisms and analytic approach for ac interference
    effects on conductive linear facilities due to the operation of co-located electric
    transmission lines. The common mechanisms for ac interference such as magnetic
    inductive coupling, capacitive coupling, and conductive voltage transfer through
    soil are discussed. Included are general guidelines and considerations for performing
    detailed ac interference analyses, with sections specific to the analysis of co-located
    pipeline and railroad facilities. This guide does not dictate specific compliance
    limits, direct when an ac interference analysis must be performed, or cover other
    issues that may need to be considered in joint-use corridors, such as effects
    due to lightning striking the line or dc corrosion on structures.
