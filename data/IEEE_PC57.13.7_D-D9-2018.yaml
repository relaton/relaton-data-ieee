abstract:
- content: Milliampere-range current transformers (CTs) are not addressed in the scope
    of IEEE Std C57.13-2016. The evaluation, certification, and specification of milliampere
    CTs is enabled in this standard similar to the present process available for 5-A
    secondary output CTs.
