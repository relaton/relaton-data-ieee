abstract:
- content: This standard is for synchronized phasor measurement systems in power systems.
    It defines a synchronized phasor (synchrophasor), frequency and rate of change
    of frequency measurements. It describes timetag and synchronization requirements
    for measurement of all three of these quantities. It specifies methods for evaluating
    these measurements, and requirements for compliance with the standard under both
    static and dynamic conditions. It defines a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) which
    can be a stand-alone physical unit or a functional unit within another physical
    unit. This standard does not specify hardware, software or a method for computing
    phasors, frequency, or rate of change of frequency.
