abstract:
- content: 'This International Standard provides a set of tools with which to implement
    a Futurebus+¨ architecture. This high-performance bus-based system architecture
    provides a wide range of performance and cost scalability over time for multiple
    generations of single- and muliple-bus multiprocessor systems. This document,
    a companion standard to ISO/IEC 10857:1994 [ANSI/IEEE Std 896.1,1994 Edition],
    builds on the logical layer by adding requirements for three military profiles.
    It is to these profiles that products will claim conformance. Othere specifications
    that may be required in conjunction with this International Standard are [ISO/IEC
    Std 10857: 1994 [ANSI/IEEE Std 896.1, 1994 Edition], IEEE Std 896.2-1991, IEEE
    Std 896.2a-1994, IEEE Std 896.3-1993, IEEE Std 896.4-1993, IEEE P896.4a, IEEE
    Std 896.9-1994, IEEE Std 1101.3-1993, IEEE Std 1101.4-1993, IEEE Std 1212-1991,
    IEEE Std 1194.1-1991, IEEE Std P1394, IEEE Std 1301-1991, and IEEE Std 1301.1-1991.'
