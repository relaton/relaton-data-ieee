abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed 2008. Recommendations are made, where possible, regarding the
    performance and evaluation of temperature rise tests on oil-immersed power transformers
    beyond nameplate ratings. The intent is to assist power transformer manufacturers,
    and the ultimate users, in evaluating thermal performance of the transformers
    under varying loads.
