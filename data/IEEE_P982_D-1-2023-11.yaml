abstract:
- content: Definitions, sample requirements, equations, and guidance for data collection
    and analysis necessary to make consistent and actionable measurements of a software
    system’s reliability, availability, supportability, and recoverability are provided
    in this document. The dependability of software systems is collectively defined
    by these characteristics.
