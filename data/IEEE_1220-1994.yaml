abstract:
- content: The interdisciplinary tasks that are required throughout a system's life
    cycle to transform customer needs, requirements, and constraints into a system
    solution are defined. This standard applies to a performing activity within an
    enterprise that is responsible for developing a product design and establishing
    the life cycle infrastructure needed to provide for life cycle sustainment. It
    specifies the requirements for the systems engineering process and its application
    throughout the product life cycle. The requirements of this standard are applicable
    to new products as well as incremental enhancements to existing products
