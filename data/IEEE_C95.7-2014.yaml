abstract:
- content: Elements of a radio frequency (RF) exposure safety program that provide
    reasonable and adequate guidance for preventing exposures in excess of recognized
    limits to electromagnetic fields from RF sources that operate in the frequency
    range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz are described in IEEE Std C95.7&#x2122;-2014. The means
    for accomplishing this are classifying exposure locations into one of four categories
    based on the potential hazard, as defined by exposure limits, and specifying appropriate
    controls for each category. Such controls include engineering and administrative
    controls as well as the use of personal protective equipment, placement of appropriate
    RF safety signage, designation of restricted access areas, the use of personal
    RF monitors, and RF safety awareness training. These recommendations are not intended
    to apply to the purposeful exposure of patients by or under the direction of medical
    practitioners, but can be used in the development of safety programs for medical
    staff and other persons working with or incidentally exposed to RF fields, and
    for those wearing implanted or external medical electronic devices. Although designed
    to complement IEEE Std C95.1&#x2122;, this recommended practice may also be used
    for the development of programs to ensure conformance with other guidelines, standards,
    or regulations for controlling human exposure to electromagnetic energy as well
    as IEEE Std C95.6&#x2122; in which case, appropriate modifications will be necessary
    to address the low frequency region addressed by IEEE Std C95.6&#x2122;.
