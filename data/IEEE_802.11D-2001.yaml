abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies the extensions to IEEE Std 802.11 ¤ for Wireless
    Local AreaNetworks providing specifications for conformant operation beyond the
    original six regulatory domains of that standard. These extensions provide a mechanism
    for an IEEE Std 802.11 access point to deliver the required radio transmitter
    parameters to an IEEE Std 802.11 mobile station,which allows that station to configure
    its radio to operate within the applicable regulations of ageographic or political
    subdivision. This mechanism is applicable to all IEEE Std 802.11 PHYtypes. A secondary
    benefit of the mechanism described in this amendment is the ability for anIEEE
    Std 802.11 moble station to roam between regulatory domains
