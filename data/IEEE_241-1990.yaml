abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the Color Books family. A guide
    and general reference on electrical design for commercial buildings is provided.
    It covers load characteristics; voltage considerations; power sources and distribution
    systems; power distribution apparatus; controllers; services, vaults, and electrical
    equipment rooms; wiring systems; systems protection and coordination; lighting;
    electric space conditioning; transportation; communication systems planning; facility
    automation; expansion, modernization, and rehabilitation; special requirements
    by occupancy; and electrical energy management. Although directed to the power
    oriented engineer with limited commercial building experience, it can be an aid
    to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of commercial buildings.
    This recommended practice is not intended to be a complete handbook; however,
    it can direct the engineer to texts, periodicals, and references for commercial
    buildings and act as a guide through the myriad of codes, standards, and practices
    published by the IEEE, other professional associations, and governmental bodies.
