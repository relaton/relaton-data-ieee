abstract:
- content: Motor Vehicle Event Data Recorders (MVEDRs) collect, record, store and
    export data related to motor vehicle pre-defined events. This standard defines
    a protocol for MVEDR output data compatibility and export protocols of MVEDR data
    elements. This standard does not prescribe which specific data elements shall
    be recorded, or how the data are to be collected, recorded and stored. It is applicable
    to event data recorders for all types of motor vehicles licensed to operate on
    public roadways, whether offered as original or aftermarket equipment, whether
    stand-alone or integrated within the vehicle.
