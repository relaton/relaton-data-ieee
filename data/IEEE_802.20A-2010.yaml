abstract:
- content: This amendment enhances IEEE 802.20 Management Information Base (MIB) clauses
    to include additional information and MIB documentation (i.e., a discussion of
    security impacts, and cross references to the text for appropriate parameters
    within the MIB, itself) to conform with the applicable parts of the lETF's 2008
    guidelines for MIBs. The amendment also corrects any errors, inconsistencies,
    and ambiguities associated with the MIB clause of IEEE Std 802.20-2008.
