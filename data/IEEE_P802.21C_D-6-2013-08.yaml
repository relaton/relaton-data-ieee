abstract:
- content: This standard specifies additional IEEE 802 media access independent mechanisms
    that optimize handovers between possibly heterogeneous IEEE 802 systems and between
    IEEE 802 systems and cellular systems, to enable improved handover performance
    for single-radio devices.
