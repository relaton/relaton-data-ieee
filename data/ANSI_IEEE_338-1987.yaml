abstract:
- content: Design and operational criteria are provided for the performance of periodic
    testing as part of the surveillance program of nuclear power generating station
    safety systems. Such testing consists of functional tests and checks, calibration
    verification, and time-response measurements, as required, to verify that the
    safety system performs to meet its defined safety function. The system status,
    associated system documentation, test intervals, and test procedures during operation
    are also addressed.
