abstract:
- content: A method for computation of an energy efficiency upper bound for an apparatus
    (wireless or wired) processing a particular communication signal waveform is specified
    in this standard. This method utilizes the signal envelope probability density
    function in combination with apparatus’ power dissipation characteristics to calculate
    the energy efficiency upper bound. The purpose of this standard is to provide
    a consistent tool to other Working Groups and other practitioners who need to
    evaluate any communication signal waveforms potential for energy efficiency when
    implemented in hardware.
