abstract:
- content: A set of codes and formats to be used by devices connected via the IEEE
    488.1 bus is specified. This standard also defines communication protocols that
    are necessary to effect application-independent and device-dependent message exchanges,
    and furthere defines common commands and characteristics useful in instrument
    system applications. It is intended to apply to small-scale to medium-scale instrument
    systems comprised mainly of measurement, stimulus, and interconnect devices outside
    the scope of the instrument system environment. IEEE 488.1 subsets, standard message-handling
    protocols including error handling, unambiguous program and response-message syntactic
    structures, common commands useful in a wide range of instrument system applications,
    standard status reporting structures, and system configuration and synchronization
    protocols are covered.
