abstract:
- content: It is the responsibility of IEEE Technical Committees to prepare functional
    Test Procedures for the thermal evaluation and classification of the insulation
    systems used in electric equipment. These Test Procedures involve accelerated
    thermal aging based on conditions of use and specify tests that the Committees
    deem pertinent. The objective of these Test Procedures is to provide for the classification
    of insulation systems for electric equipment in accordance with their temperature
    limits by test rather than by chemical composition of the component materials
    of the system. It is recognized that a given insulation system may be used under
    different conditions of temperature, time, voltage, etc. Therefore, the evaluation
    of an insulation system involves all of the various parameters of application
    and use of equipment but not the evaluation of separate component materials. The
    evaluation of insulating materials and simple combinations thereof is provided
    for by separate material Test Procedures. It is the purpose of this Guide to provide
    a general form for the preparation of systems Test Procedures and to suggest the
    points to be considered by the Technical Committees in the preparation of specific
    instructions for the thermal evaluation of insulation systems for equipment.
