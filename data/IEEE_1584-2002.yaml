abstract:
- content: This guide provides techniques for designers and facility operators to
    apply in determining the arc flash hazard distance and the incident energy to
    which employees could be exposed during their work on or near electrical equipment.
    Included are 2 Arc Flash Hazard Calculators and 3 Test Data files. Contact stds-help@ieee.org
    for these additional files. An interpretation is available at http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/interp/1584-2002.html
