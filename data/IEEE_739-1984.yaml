abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 739-1995 This recommended practice serves as an
    engineering guide for use in electrical design for energy conservation. It provides
    a standard design practice to assist engineers in evaluating electrical options
    from an energy standpoint. It establishes engineering techniques and procedures
    to allow efficiency optimization in the design and operation of an electrical
    system considering all aspects (safety, costs, environment, those occupying the
    facility, management needs, etc.).
