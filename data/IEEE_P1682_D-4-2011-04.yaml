abstract:
- content: This standard provides general requirements, directions and methods for
    qualifying Class 1E fiber optic cables, terminations, field splices, connectors
    and interfaces for service in nuclear facilities including power generating stations,
    fuel reprocessing stations and other related installations. Cables, optical fibers,
    and splices within or integral to other devices (e.g., sensors, instruments, panels,
    etc.) shall be qualified using the requirements in the applicable device standard
    or IEEE Std. 323-2003, as appropriate. However, the requirements of this standard
    may be applied to the fiber optic cable and interfaces within these devices.
