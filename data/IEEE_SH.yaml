abstract:
- content: Withdrawn March 2000. Terms that apply to linear, passive, reciprocal,
    time-invariant networks are defined. The terms apply to mathematical concepts
    that represent idealizations of physical phenomena. Thus, the definitions apply
    to idealized models that are useful in describing properties of physical networks.
    The question of whether or not a certain term is applicable to a particular physical
    situation is left to the user.
