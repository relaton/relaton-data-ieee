abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies protocols, procedures and managed objects that
    support congestion management of long-lived data flows within network domains
    of limited bandwidth-delay product. This is achieved by enabling bridges to signal
    congestion to end stations capable of transmission rate limiting to avoid frame
    loss.
