abstract:
- content: A method is provided for specifying power intent for an electronic design,
    for use in verification of the structure and behavior of the design in the context
    of a given power management architecture, and for driving implementation of that
    power-management architecture. The method supports incremental refinement of power
    intent specifications required for IP-based design flows.(The PDF of this standard
    is available to you at no cost thru the IEEE GET program https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=80)
