abstract:
- content: IEEE Standard for Exposed Semiconducting Shields on High-Voltage Cable
    Joints and Separable Insulated Connectors, provides design tests for shield resistance
    and a simulated fault-current initiation for exposed semiconducting shields used
    on cable accessories, specifically joints and separable insulated connectors rated
    15 kV through 35 kV.
