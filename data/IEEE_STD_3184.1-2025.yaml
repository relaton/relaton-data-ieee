abstract:
- content: A joint calibration framework for roadside sensors—such as camera, Light
    Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), millimeter-wave radio detection and ranging (radar),
    and fused sensors— is defined by this standard. The types of sensors involved
    (including their characteristics and measurement data features), the reference
    coordinate system, the calibration process, and the tools for calibrating the
    sensors are defined by this standard. Additionally, a data analysis method to
    assess the accuracy and reliability of the calibration results is defined by this
    standard.
