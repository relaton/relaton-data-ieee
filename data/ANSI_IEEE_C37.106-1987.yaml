abstract:
- content: This guide has been prepared to assist the protection engineer in applying
    relays for the protection of generating plant equipment from damage caused by
    operation at abnormal frequencies including overexcitation. Emphasis is placed
    on the protection of the major generating station components at steam generating
    stations, nuclear stations, and at combustion-turbine installations. Consideration
    is also given to the effect of abnormal frequency operation on those associated
    station auxiliaries whose response can affect plant output. The guide also presents
    background information regarding the hazards caused by operating generating equipment
    at abnormal frequencies. It documents typical equipment capabilities and describes
    acceptable protective schemes. Recommended methods for coordinating the underfrequency
    protective scheme with system-load shielding schemes are also included. Sufficient
    information is provided to apply suitable coordinated protection for given specific
    situations.
