abstract:
- content: This application guide for the relay protection of squirrel-cage and wound-rotor
    induction motors and synchronous motors presents a review of the generally accepted
    forms of motor protection and summarizes the use of relays and devices, singly
    and in combination, so the reader may select the necessary equipment to obtain
    adequate motor protection. The guide is concerned primarily with the protection
    of three-phase integral horsepower motors and refers to two-phase motors only
    in special instances where specifically indicated.
