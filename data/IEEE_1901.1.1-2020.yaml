abstract:
- content: The interoperability and compliance testing for IEEE 1901.1 products built,
    in which physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers of the medium frequency
    band (less than 12 MHz) broadband power line communication technology for smart
    grid applications (SGPLC) based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
    (OFDM), is specified in this standard. The corresponding PLC application scenarios
    and test environment are introduced, and the PHY/MAC test cases and test scenarios
    are provided. The procedures for compliance, interoperability, and certification
    of IEEE Std 1901.1(TM) are specified in this standard.
