abstract:
- content: 'Near-field test practices for the measurement of antenna properties are
    described in this document and near-field measurement practices for the three
    principal geometries: cylindrical, planar, and spherical are recommended. Measurement
    practices for the calibration of probes used as reference antennas in near-field
    measurements are also recommended.'
