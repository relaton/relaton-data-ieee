abstract:
- content: A comprehensive guide to the methods and configurations for the protection
    of power system shunt reactors is provided in this guide. The protection of oil-immersed
    reactors equipped with auxiliary power windings, improved turn-to-turn protection,
    and use of digital (microprocessor-based) protection for shunt reactors are included.
