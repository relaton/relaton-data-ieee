abstract:
- content: This guide covers mineral insulating oil commonly defined as transformer
    oil; definition and description of reclaiming procedures; the test methods used
    to evaluate the progress and end point of the reclamation process, and what criteria
    recommended for the use of reclaimed oils are considered suitable. This guide
    does not cover the use of oil in new apparatus under warranty.
