abstract:
- content: This standard provides specifications for a high-speed serial bus that
    supports both asynchronous and isochronous communication and integrates well with
    most IEEE standard 32-bit and 64-bit parallel buses. It is intended to provide
    a low-cost interconnect between cards on the same backplane, cards on other backplanes,
    and external peripherals. Interfaces to longer distance transmission media [such
    as unshielded twisted pair (UTP), optical fiber, and plastic optical fiber (POF)]
    allow the interconnection to be extended throughout a local network. This standard
    follows the command and status register (CSR) architecture of IEEE Std 1212trade-2001.
