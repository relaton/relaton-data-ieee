abstract:
- content: '" This standard establishes methods for testing and measuring the performance
    charac-teristics for surge-protective devices used in low-voltage ac power circuits.
    Definitions are statedthat apply specifically to surge-protective devices. The
    testing requirements are categorized intotwo groups, in which a minimum set of
    basic tests (BTs) are prescribed for all surge-protectivedevices within the scope
    of its documents, supplemented by additional tests (ATs) that might beneeded to
    establish particular application requirements. "'
