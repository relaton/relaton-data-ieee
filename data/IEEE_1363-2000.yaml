abstract:
- content: This standard specifies common public-key cryptographic techniques, including
    mathematical primitives for secret value (key) derivation, public-key encryption,
    and digital signatures, and cryptographic schemes based on those primitives. It
    also specifies related cryptographic parameters, public keys, and private keys.
    The purpose of this standard is to provide a reference for specifications on a
    variety of techniques from which applications may select.
