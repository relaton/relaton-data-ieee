abstract:
- content: 'This amendment enhances the Ultra Wideband (UWB) physical layers (PHYs)
    medium access control (MAC), and associated ranging techniques while retaining
    backward compatibility with enhanced ranging capable devices (ERDEVs). Areas of
    enhancement include: additional coding, preamble and modulation schemes to support
    improved link budget and/or reduced air-time; additional channels and operating
    frequencies; interference mitigation techniques to support greater device density
    and higher traffic use cases; improvements to accuracy, precision and reliability
    and interoperability for high-integrity ranging; schemes to reduce complexity
    and power consumption; definitions for tightly coupled hybrid operation with narrowband
    signaling to assist UWB; enhanced native discovery and connection setup mechanisms;
    UWB sensing capabilities to support presence detection and environment mapping;
    and mechanisms supporting low-power low-latency streaming as well as high data-rate
    streaming allowing at least 50 Mbit/s of throughput; and, support for peer-to-peer,
    peer-to-multi-peer, and station-to-infrastructure protocols and infrastructure
    synchronization mechanisms.'
