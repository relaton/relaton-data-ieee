abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 62271 is applicable to three-phase AC high-voltage generator
    circuit breakers, hereafter called generator circuit-breakers, designed for indoor
    or outdoor installation and for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz on
    systems having voltages above 1 kV and up to 38 kV. It is applicable to generator
    circuit-breakers that are installed between the generator and the transformer
    terminals. Requirements relative to generator circuit-breakers intended for use
    with generators and transformers rated 10 MVA or more are covered specifically.
    Generator circuits rated less than 10 MVA and pumped-storage installations are
    considered special applications, and their requirements are not completely covered
    by this document. This document is also applicable to the operating mechanisms
    of generator circuit-breakers and to their auxiliary equipment.
