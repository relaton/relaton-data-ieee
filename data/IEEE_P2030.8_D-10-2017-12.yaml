abstract:
- content: A key element of microgrid operation is the microgrid controller and more
    specifically the energy management system. It includes the control functions that
    define the microgrid as a system that can manage itself, and operate autonomously
    or grid connected, and seamlessly connect to and disconnect from the main distribution
    grid for the exchange of power and the supply of ancillary services, including
    for the distribution system to which it is connected. It is recognized that microgrid
    components and operational solutions exist in different configurations with different
    implementations. The scope of this standard is to develop a set of testing procedures
    allowing the verification, the quantification of the performance and a comparison
    of the performance with expected minimum requirements of the different functions
    of the microgrid controller that are common to the control of all microgrids,
    regardless of topology, configuration or jurisdiction. It aims to present metrics
    for a comparison of the control functions required from both the microgrid operator
    and the distribution system operator. The reason for establishing a standard for
    testing microgrid controllers, in the context of enabling interoperability of
    the different controllers and components needed to operate the controller through
    cohesive and platform-independent interfaces, is to establish standardized testing
    criteria leading to procedures. This approach allows for flexibility and customization
    of components and control algorithms to be 16 deployed without limiting potential
    functionality, while ensuring minimum requirements are met. The standardization
    focuses on testing functional requirements, while recognizing that there are many
    possible hardware and software implementations of the same microgrid controller
    generic functions. The interoperability with various Distributed Energy Resource
    (DER) interfaces, and other electrical system interfaces within the microgrid
    should be considered. A standardized set of testing criteria/procedures should
    facilitate the wide adoption standard microgrid controller functional and performance
    requirements by vendors and utilities, including the Distribution System Operator,
    for ease of interfacing with the Distribution Management System. The standard
    is functionality-driven and focuses on a modular approach to the implementation
    of the functional requirements.
