abstract:
- content: Basic principles for design qualification of safety systems equipment used
    in nuclear power generating stations are provided. Specification criteria, the
    development of a qualification program, and documentation are addressed. All types
    of safety systems equipment--mechanical and instrumentation as well as electrical--are
    covered. Principles and procedures for preparing specific safety systems equipment
    standards are established.
