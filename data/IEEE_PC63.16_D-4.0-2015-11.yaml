abstract:
- content: This ANSI ESD guide provides expanded explanations, best practices, and
    guidance for avoiding the pitfalls associated with ESD testing to IEC and other
    international ESD standards and should be considered a supplement to these standards,
    rather than a replacement. It also includes unique ESD test procedures related
    to connecting charged peripherals to equipment in use.
