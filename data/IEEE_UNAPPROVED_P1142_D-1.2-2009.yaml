abstract:
- content: This guide provides detailed information relating to the design, testing,
    application and installation of various types of electrical cables in order to
    prevent the deleterious effect of moisture and chemical ingress and resultant
    failures in service. This includes single and multiconductor cables over a complete
    range of voltage ratings. Testing criteria and installation methods covered along
    with many technical references.
