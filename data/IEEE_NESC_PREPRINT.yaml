abstract:
- content: This Preprint provides the full text of each change proposal (CP) to revise
    the 2023 Edition of the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), together with
    the initial recommendation of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the
    rule addressed by the CP. The purpose of the NESC 2028 Preprint is to solicit
    public comment for each of the CPs and initial Subcommittee actions. The public
    comment period is 1 July 2025 to 24 March 2026. Subcommittees will consider the
    original change proposal, the initial recommendations, and public comment to develop
    final recommendations in the Fall of 2026, for final approval by the NESC Main
    Committee in 2027.
