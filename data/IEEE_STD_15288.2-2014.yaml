abstract:
- content: The requirements for technical reviews and audits to be performed throughout
    the acquisition life cycle for the US Department of Defense (DoD) and other defense
    agencies are established in this standard. This standard provides the definition,
    description, and intent, as well as the entry/exit/success criteria, for each
    technical review and audit. It is to be used to establish agreement between acquirers
    and suppliers on the technical reviews and audits that are needed for the project,
    as well as the focus and expectations of each. ( Adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC/IEEE
    24748-8:2019)
