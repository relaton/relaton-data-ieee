abstract:
- content: Identity assertion, role gathereing, multilevel access control, assurance,
    and auditing are provided by the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS). The
    BOPS implementation includes software running on a client device, a trusted BOPS
    server, and an intrusion detection system. The BOPS implementation allows pluggable
    components to replace existing components’ functionality, accepting integration
    into current operating environments in a short period of time. The BOPS implementation
    provides continuous protection to the resources and assurance of the placement
    and viability of adjudication and otherre key features. Accountability is the
    mechanism that proves a service-level guarantee of security. The BOPS implementation
    allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming
    interface. The BOPS implementation need not know whethere the underlying system
    is a relational database management system or a search engine. The BOPS implementation
    functionality offers a “point-and-cut” mechanism to add the appropriate security
    to the production systems as well as to the systems in development. The architecture
    is language neutral, allowing Representational State Transfer (REST), JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON), and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) to provide the communication interface. The architecture is built on the
    servlet specification, open SSLs, Java, JSON, REST, and an open persistent store.
    All tools adhere to open standards, allowing maximum interoperability.
