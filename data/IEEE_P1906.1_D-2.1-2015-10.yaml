abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides a definition, terminology, conceptual
    model, and standard metrics for ad hoc network communication at the nanoscale.
    The physical properties of nanoscale communication extend human-engineered networking
    in ways beyond that defined in existing communication standards including in vivo,
    sub-cellular medical communication, smart materials and sensing at the molecular
    level, and the ability to operate in environments that would be too harsh for
    macroscale communication mechanisms to operate. Nanoscale communication also requires
    collaboration among a highly-diverse set of disciplines with differing definitions
    and connotations for some terms, thus a common terminology is required in order
    to aid in inter-discipline collaboration. A common framework for thinking abstractly
    about nanoscale communication aids in defining and relating research and development
    effort. Components of the framework are independent enough to allow them to be
    developed in relative isolation, yet the components are also interoperable. Example
    mappings between specific nanoscale communication use-cases and the common framework
    serve to illustrate the recommended practice. Simulation code implementing the
    common framework for both wireless and molecular nanoscale communication provides
    an embodiment of the common framework demonstrating precisely how the framework
    is applied.
