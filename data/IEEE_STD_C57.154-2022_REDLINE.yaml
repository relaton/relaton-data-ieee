abstract:
- content: Covered in this standard are all liquid-immersed distribution, power, and
    regulating transformers that are designed to operate at temperatures that exceed
    the normal thermal limits of IEEE C57.12.00 under continuous load, in the designed
    average ambient, and at rated conditions. Specific requirements and guidance in
    the design, testing, and application of the transformers covered within the scope
    of this standard are provided. High-temperature insulation systems or systems
    that use a combination of high-temperature and conventional insulation are incorporated
    by these transformers.
