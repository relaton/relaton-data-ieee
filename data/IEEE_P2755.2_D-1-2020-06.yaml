abstract:
- content: Provided in this recommended practice is a comprehensive methodology for
    technology domain exploration, development of strategy, technology evaluation,
    implementation, management, operations, program optimization, and successful enterprise
    scaling for IPA programs while utilizing terminology as established in IEEE Std
    2755&#8482;-2017 and technology taxonomy as established in IEEE Std 2755.1&#8482;-2019.
    This recommended practice is a compilation of best practices from industry leaders
    on the proven methods from the initial discovery and exploration of the transformative
    capabilities of IPA technology through to developing and running an enterprise-wide
    program.
