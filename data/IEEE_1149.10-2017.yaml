abstract:
- content: Circuitry that may be built into an integrated circuit to assist in the
    test, maintenance, and support of assembled printed circuit boards, assembled
    multi-die packages, and the test of die internal circuits is defined in this standard.
    The circuitry includes a high-speed TAP (HSTAP) with a packet encoder/decoder
    and distribution architecture through which instructions and test data are communicated.
    The standard leverages the languages of IEEE Std 1149.1(TM) to describe and operate
    the on-chip circuits.
