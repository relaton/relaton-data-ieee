abstract:
- content: Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS) provides Identity Assertion, Role
    Gathering, Multi-Level Access Control, Assurance, and Auditing. The BOPS includes
    software running on a client device (Android, iPhone, etc.), a trusted BOPS Server,
    and an Intrusion Detection(IDS) system. The BOPS allows pluggable components to
    replace existing components functionality accepting integration into current operating
    environments in a short period of time. The BOPS provides continuous protection
    to the resources and assurance of the placement and viability of adjudication,
    and other key features. Accountability is the mechanism that proves a service
    level guarantee of security. The BOPS allows the systems to meet security needs
    by using the API.The BOPS need not know whether the underlying system is a Relational
    Database Management System (RDBMS) or a Search Engine. The BOPS functionality
    offers a point and cut mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production
    systems as well as to the systems in development. The architecture is a language
    neutral allowing REST, JSON and Secure Socket Layers(SSL) to provide the communication
    interface. The architecture is built on the servlet specification, open secure
    socket layers, Java, JSON, REST and Apache Solr. Each and every tool adheres to
    the open standards allowing maximum interoperability.
