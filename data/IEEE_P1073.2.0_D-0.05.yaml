abstract:
- content: This project is limited to service and protocol definitions that are identified
    in IEEE 1073.2, "Framework and Overview" and are used by related medical device
    application profile standards, e.g. P1073.2n. The definitions augment and in some
    cases optimize related industry standards, chiefly ISO Systems Management standards,
    particularly with respect to cost-performance improvements for real-time medical
    data communication.
