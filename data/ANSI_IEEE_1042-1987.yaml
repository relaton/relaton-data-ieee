abstract:
- content: The application of configuration management (CM) disciplines to the management
    of software engineering projects is described. For those planning software configuration
    management (SCM) activities, this guide provides insight into the various factors
    that must be considered. For users implementing SCM disciplines, suggestions and
    detailed examples of plans are provided. An interpretation is given of how ANSI/IEEE
    Std 828-1983, IEEE Standard for Software Configuration Management Plans, can be
    used for planning the management of different kinds of computer program development
    and maintenance activities.
