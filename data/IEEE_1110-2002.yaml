abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std 1110-1991. Reaffirmed September 2007. Categorizes
    three direct-axis and four quadrature-axis models, along with the basic transient
    reactance model. Discusses some of the assumptions made in using various models
    and presents the fundamental equations and concepts involved in generator/system
    interfacing. Covers, generally, the various attributes of power system stability,
    recognizing two basic approaches. The first is categorized under large disturbance
    nonlinear analysis; the second approach considers small disturbances, where the
    corresponding dynamic equations are linearized. Applications of a range of generator
    models are discussed and treated. The manner in which generator saturation is
    treated in stability studies, both in the initialization process as well as during
    large or small disturbance stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation
    functions that are derived, whether from test data or by the methods, of finite
    elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating values
    of excitation and internal power angle depending upon generator terminal conditions
    are compared. The question of parameter determination is covered. Two approaches
    in accounting for generator field and excitation system base quantities are identified.
    Conversion factors are given for transferring field parameters from one base to
    another for correct generator/excitation system interface modeling, Suggestions
    for modeling of negative field currents and other field circuit discontinuities
    are included.
