abstract:
- content: 'This standard describes the functions, and features and protocol of the
    logical link control (LLC) sublayer in the local area network protocol. It describes
    the LLC sublayer interface service specifications to the network layer, to the
    medium access control (MAC) sublayer, and to the LLC sublayer management function.
    IEEE Std 802.2-1985 provides a description of the peer-to-peer protocol procedures
    that are defined for the transfer of information and control between any pair
    of data link layer service access points on a local area network. To satisfy a
    broad range of potential applications, two types of data link control operation
    are included. They are: a data-link-connectionless service across a data link
    with minimum protocol complexity, and a data-link-connection-oriented service
    across a data link comparable to existing data link control procedures provided
    in national and international standards. Two distinct ''classes'' of LLC operation
    are identified. Class I provides data-link-connectionless service only and Class
    II provides data-link-connection-oriented service plus data-link-connectionless
    service.<<ETX>>'
