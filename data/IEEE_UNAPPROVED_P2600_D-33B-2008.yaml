abstract:
- content: This standard defines security requirements (all aspects of security including
    but not limited to authentication, authorization, privacy, integrity, device management,
    physical security and information security) for manufacturers, users and others
    on the selection, installation, configuration and usage of hardcopy devices and
    systems including printers, copiers, and multifunction devices and the computer
    systems that support these devices. This standard identifies security exposures
    for these hardcopy devices and systems and instructs manufacturers and software
    developers on appropriate security capabilities to include in their devices and
    systems and instructs users on appropriate ways to use these security capabilities.
