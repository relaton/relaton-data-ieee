abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Dec 06, 1990. This standard applies
    to electrotherremic power meters as complete instruments and to their constituent
    parts: electrotherremic elements, electrotherremic units, and electrotherremic
    power indicators. Electrotherremic power measurement instrumentation is generally
    used to measure (below 3 W and above 2 MHz) the average power of an electromagnetic
    wave propagating in a single mode in waveguide or coaxial transmission lines.
    The power range can be extended by the use of attenuators or directional couplers,
    or both.'
