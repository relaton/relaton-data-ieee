abstract:
- content: Design This guide provides designinformation for the methods historically
    and typically applied by substation designers to minimize reduce direct lightning
    strokes to equipment and buswork within substations is provided. Two approaches,
    the classical empirical method and the electrogeometric model, are presented in
    detail. A third approach involving the use of active lightning terminals is also
    briefly reviewed.
