abstract:
- content: The rapidly expanding use of solid-state controllers requires consideration
    of many factors not previously important in the design, installation, and operation
    of other forms of controllers. Many portions of the control circuits of solid-state
    controllers designed for operation at low-energy low voltage signal levels are
    susceptible to disturbances by excessive electrical noise. Erratic controller
    operation may result unless suitable precautions are taken. The following recommendations
    are intended as an installation guide for industrial controls involving low-energy
    level equipment to minimize electrical noise inputs from external sources. The
    electrical noise guide is comprised of six sections. Sections 1 and 2 state the
    scope and service conditions. Sections 3 through 5 provide the technical foundation
    for the recommendations given in Section 6. Section 6 is intended to stand alone
    as the working section of the electrical noise guide.
