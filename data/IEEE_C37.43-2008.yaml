abstract:
- content: Specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) distribution and power class
    expulsion, current-limiting, and combination-type external capacitor fuses and
    accessories, with rated voltages from 1 kV through 38 kV, for protecting shunt
    capacitors complying with IEEE Std 18-2002 and NEMA CP 1-2000, are established
    in this standard. All of these devices are intended for use on AC systems. These
    fuses may be used with capacitor units, groups of units, or entire capacitor banks.
