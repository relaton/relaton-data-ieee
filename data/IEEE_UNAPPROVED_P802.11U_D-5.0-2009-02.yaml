abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies enhancements to the 802.11 MAC that support WLAN
    Interworking with External Networks. It enables higher layer functionalities to
    provide overall end-to-end solutions. The main goals of 802.11u are aiding network
    discovery and selection, enabling information transfer from external networks,
    enabling emergency services, and SSPNs' to 802.11 Network that support WLAN Interworking
    with External Networks.
