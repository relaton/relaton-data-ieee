abstract:
- content: 'Seismic design recommendations for substations, including qualification
    of different equipment types are discussed in this amendment. Design recommendations
    consist of seismic criteria, qualification methods and levels, structural capacities,
    performance requirements for equipment operation, installation methods, and documentation.
