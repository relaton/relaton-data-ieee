abstract:
- content: Standard methods and basic techniques for high-voltage testing applicable
    to all types of apparatus for alternating voltages, direct voltages, lightning
    impulse voltages, switching impulse voltages, and impulse currents are established
    in this standard. Sections that deal with alternating voltage, direct voltage,
    and impulse testing are combined in this revision to organize the technical content
    for ease of use. In addition, the concept of measurement uncertainty in evaluation
    of high-voltage and high-current tests is introduced in this version.
