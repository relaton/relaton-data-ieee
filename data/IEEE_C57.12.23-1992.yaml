abstract:
- content: Electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics and certain safety
    features of single-phase, 60 Hz, mineral-oil-immersed, self-cooled, distribution
    transformers with separable insulated high-voltage connectors are covered. Ratings,
    testing, and construction are discussed. These transformers are generally used
    for step-down pruposes from an underground primary cable supply and are suitable
    for occasional submerged operation. The intent is to provide a basis for determining
    their performance, interchangeability, and safety, and for their selection. This
    standard does not cover the electrical and mechanical requirements of accessory
    devices that may be supplied with the transformer
