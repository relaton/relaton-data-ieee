abstract:
- content: Techniques and instrumentation for the measurement and computation of electric,
    magnetic, and electromagnetic (EM) fields in the near field of an EM field source
    are presented in this recommended practice. Descriptions of the concepts, techniques,
    and instruments that can be applied to the measurement of the electric and magnetic
    fields and the currents induced in the human body by these fields are provided.
    Techniques for determining the current density and the electric field strength
    within the human body are discussed. This recommended practice is intended primarily
    for use by engineers, biophysicists, and other specialists who are familiar with
    basic EM field theory and practice, and the potential hazards associated with
    EM fields. It will be most useful to bioeffects researchers, instrumentation developers
    and manufacturers, those developing calibration systems and standards, and persons
    involved in critical hazard assessments or hazard surveys.
