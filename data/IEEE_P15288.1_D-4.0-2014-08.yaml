abstract:
- content: 'This standard provides requirements for the application of ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288, System Life Cycle Processes, for defense systems engineering needs. This
    standard implements ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 for use by United States Department of
    Defense (DoD) organizations and other defense agencies in acquiring systems or
    systems engineering support. While primarily supporting the acquirer-supplier
    agreement mode, this standard also can be used to support the other modes: use
    by organizations, projects, and process assessors. This standard provides the
    basis for selection, negotiation, agreement, and performance of necessary systems
    engineering activities and delivery of products, while allowing flexibility for
    both innovative implementation and tailoring of the specific systems engineering
    process(es) to be used by system suppliers, either contractors or government system
    developers, integrators, maintainers, and/or sustainers.'
