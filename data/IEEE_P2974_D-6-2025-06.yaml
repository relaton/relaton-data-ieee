abstract:
- content: 'This guide specifies the test requirements of system commissioning which
    are applicable to the DC (direct current) distribution network of the voltage
    level from 750 V to ±50 kV. The guide mainly includes the following aspects: the
    converter (AC (alternating current)/DC, DC/DC) test; the DC circuit breaker test;
    the test of active and passive network conversion; the test of the operation characteristics
    of low voltage DC islanded operation system; the test of feeder power balance
    system; the coordinated operation test of medium and low voltage DC system; the
    plug and play system test; the small power system test; the large power system
    test; the rated load test; the overload test; the short circuit test; and the
    trial operation.'
