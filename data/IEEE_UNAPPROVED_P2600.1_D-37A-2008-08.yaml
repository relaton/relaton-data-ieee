abstract:
- content: Standard for a Protection Profile for Hardcopy Devices in a restrictive
    commercial information processing environment in which a relatively high level
    of document security, operational accountability, and information assurance, are
    required. Typical information processed in this environment is trade secret, mission-critical,
    or subject to legal and regulatory considerations such as for privacy or governance.
    This environment is not intended to support life-critical or national security
    applications. This environment will be known as "Operational Environment A."
