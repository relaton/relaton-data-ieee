abstract:
- content: A set of standard verification tasks for processor-based equipment used
    in safety-critical applications on rail and transit systems is covered. This standard
    also covers processes that verify the level of safety achieved in the implementation
    of safety-critical functions that are required to be fail-safe. Quality assurance
    or validation processes that affect the overall level of system safety are not
    covered.
