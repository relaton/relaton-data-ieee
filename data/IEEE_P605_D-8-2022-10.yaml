abstract:
- content: 'A proper design of the substation bus is aimed towards a safe and reliable
    operation of the substation and the power system. Two different types of buses
    are used in substations: the rigid bus and the strain (cable). Information is
    provided by this guide on the different bus arrangements used in substations stating
    the advantages and disadvantages of each. Information as related to each bus type
    and construction is also provided. Once the bus type is selected, the calculation
    tools for each bus type are provided by this guide. Based on these calculations,
    the bus size, forces acting on the bus structure, the number of mounting structures
    required, and hardware requirements can be specified by the engineer.'
