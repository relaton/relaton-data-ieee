abstract:
- content: Physical layer and data link layer specifications for power supply and
    communication over power lines from a dc power source to multiple dc loads are
    specified. Each receiver has its own physical address and is connected to the
    transmitter through a pair of power lines in a multidrop bus or tree topology.
    The dc power is sent by the transmitter. This dc power, by electrically changing
    the voltage of the wires, corresponds to the communication packets, including
    the control command/data for controlling the dc loads and the target address.
    Power to the dc loads with the transmitted and voltage-flattened dc power is supplied
    by each receiver. The control command/data and addresses from electric signals
    on the power line is decoded by each receiver, to be used for the connected dc
    loads control if the addresses match. The standard is in compliance with known
    electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulations.
