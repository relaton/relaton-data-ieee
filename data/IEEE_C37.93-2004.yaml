abstract:
- content: This document provides guidelines for applying audio tones over voice grade
    channels for power system relaying. Included are sections on transmitting and
    receiving equipment, leased voice grade channels, application principles, installation,
    and testing. The primary purpose of this document is to guide the power system
    user in applying, installing, and operating audio-tone protective relaying systems
    over voice grade channels. Secondly, it is to provide a reference for equipment
    manufacturers engaged in the design and application of relaying equipment and
    for telephone personnel engaged in providing telecommunications channels for audio-tone
    protective relay schemes.
