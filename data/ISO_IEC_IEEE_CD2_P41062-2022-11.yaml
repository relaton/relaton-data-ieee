abstract:
- content: This document describes a set of useful activities, tasks, methods, and
    practices that acquirers of software and related services from unrelated (external)
    suppliers can apply to help ensure an efficient and effective acquisition of software
    or software services. These practices can be applied in competitive and in sole
    source procurements, regardless of the type, size, complexity, and cost of the
    acquisition. The document can be applied to software that runs on any computer
    system regardless of its size, complexity, or criticality. The software supply
    chain can include integration of off-the-shelf (OTS), custom, software as a service
    (SaaS), or open-source software. Software services can include software development
    and sustainment (maintenance), integration, verification (testing) and operation.
    Security and safety are included as attributes to be considered during the acquisition.
    However, specific requirements for acquisition of information assurance (security),
    safety, and cloud services are not included.
