abstract:
- content: Specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) expulsion and current-limiting
    type power class fuses, fuse disconnecting switches, their associated fuse links,
    disconnecting cutouts, and accessories for these devices are covered. All of these
    devices are intended for use on alternating-current distribution systems. (This
    standard is superseded by IEEE C37.42-2016 and supersedes IEEE C37.46-2001)
