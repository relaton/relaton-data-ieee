abstract:
- content: This standard is published for the purpose of promoting clarity and consistency
    in the use of radar terminology. The definitions represent the consensus (reached
    after several rounds of review, comment, and revision) of a panel of radar experts,
    including authors of several books on radar. It is intended that these definitions
    shall serve as a guide to standardization of meanings.
