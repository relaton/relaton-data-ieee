abstract:
- content: 'This standard is intended to aid the electric power industry in reporting
    and evaluating electric generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity.
    It was developed to overcome present difficulties in the interpretation of electric
    generating unit performance data from various systems and to facilitate comparisons
    among different systems. The standard should also make possible the future exchange
    o meaningful data among systems in North America and throughout the world. Scope:
    This document standardizes terminology and indexes for reporting electric generating
    unit reliability, availability, and productivity performance measures. A generating
    unit includes all equipment up to the high-voltage terminal of the generator step-up
    transformer. Reliability in this standard encompasses measures of the ability
    of generating units to perform their intended function. Availability measures
    are concerned with the fraction of time a unit is capable of providing service,
    and account for outage frequency and duration. Productivity measures are concerned
    with the total power produced by a plant with respect to its potential power production.
    Therefore, productivity measures consider magnitude of outage as well as frequency
    and duration of outage. NOTE &#8212; This standard was developed for application
    at the unit level; the definitions are applicable below the unit level in most
    cases. There are some exceptions, however, such as the definition of in service,
    which applies only at the unit level. Because of these exceptions, care should
    be taken when using this standard below the unit level.'
