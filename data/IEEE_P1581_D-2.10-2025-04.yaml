abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1581 defines a low-cost method for testing the interconnection
    of discrete, complex memory integrated circuits (ICs) where additional pins for
    testing are not available and implementing boundary scan (IEEE Std 1149.1™) is
    not feasible. This standard describes the implementation rules for the test logic
    and test mode access/exit methods in conformant ICs. The standard is limited to
    the behavioral description of the implementation and will not include the technical
    design for the test logic or test mode control circuitry.
