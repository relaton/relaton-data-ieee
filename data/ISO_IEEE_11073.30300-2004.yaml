abstract:
- content: This standard establishes a connection-oriented transport profile and physical
    layer suitable for medical device communications that use short-range infrared
    wireless. This standard defines communications services and protocols that are
    consistent with specifications of the Infrared Data Association (IrDA) and are
    optimized for point-of-care (POC) applications at or near the patient.
