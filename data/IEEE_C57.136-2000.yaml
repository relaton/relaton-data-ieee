abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed September 22, 2005. Guidelines are provided for the selection
    of suitable sound reduction methods in oil-immersed power transformers and shunt
    reactors over 500 kVA.Sound-producing sources within transformers and reactors
    are discussed.Sound abatement procedures are described for achieving various levels
    of sound reduction in transformer and shunt reactor installations.
