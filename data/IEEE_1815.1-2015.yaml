abstract:
- content: 'This document specifies the standard approach for mapping between IEEE
    Std 1815&#x2122; [Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3)] and IEC 61850 (Communications
    Networks and Systems for Power Utility Automation). Two primary use cases are
    addressed: a) mapping between an IEEE 1815-based master and an IEC 61850-based
    remote site and b) mapping between an IEC 61850-based master and an IEEE 1815-based
    remote site. Mapping aspects included in the standard are: conceptual architecture;
    general mapping requirements; the mapping of Common Data Classes, Constructed
    Attribute Classes and Abstract Communication Service Interface (ACSI); cyber security
    requirements, the architecture of a gateway used for translation and requirements
    for embedding mapping configuration information into IEC 61850 System Configuration
    Description Language (SCL) and DNP3 Device Profile. This standard addresses a
    selection of features, data classes, and services of the two standards.** NOTE:
    Incorporates IEEE Std 1815.1-2015/Cor 1-2016, which was not published as an individual
    corrigendum.'
