abstract:
- content: 'Application guidance and test procedures are given for power transformers
    and inductors that are used in electronic equipment and supplied by power lines
    or generators of essentially sine-wave or polyphase voltage. Provision is made
    for relating the characteristics of transformers to the associated rectifiers
    and circuits. This standard includes, but is not limited to, the following transformers
    and inductors: rectifier supply transformers for either high- or low-voltage supplies,
    filament and cathode heater transformers, transformers for alternating-current
    resonant charging circuits, inductors used in rectifier filters, and autotransformers
    with fixed taps.'
