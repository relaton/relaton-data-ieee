abstract:
- content: Terminology and standard test procedures for germanium radiation detectors
    that are used for the detection and high-resolution spectrometry of gamma rays,
    X rays, and charged particles that produce hole-electron pairs in the crystal
    lattice are established so they have the same meaning to both manufacturers and
    users.
