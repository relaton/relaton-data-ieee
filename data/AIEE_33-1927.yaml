abstract:
- content: 'The standards in this section apply to the following kinds of indicating
    electrical instruments for direct current and for alternating current: (1) ammeters
    (2) voltmeters (3) wattmeters (4) reactive volt-ampere meters (5) frequency meters
    (6) power-factor, reactive-factor and phase-angle meters (7) synchroscopes. These
    standards are not intended to apply to indicating instruments provided with arrangements
    for curve drawing, contact making, etc. They do not apply to the following kinds
    of instruments: (a) small instruments of types and sizes which are used where
    low cost is essential; for example, small polarized-vane ammeters used on automobiles,
    battery-charging outfits, etc. (b) instruments constructed for very special requirements.'
