abstract:
- content: This Guide provides a recommended table of contents for high-voltage circuit
    breaker instruction manuals. The Guide provides a listing of information that
    will help a knowledgeable user receive, install, commission, operate, and maintain
    circuit breakers. Recommended additional material is described in clause 5 for
    circuit breakers that are intended for high-voltage, free-standing installations.
    Drawout circuit breakers used in switchgear are excluded from Clause 5 requirements.
    Circuit breakers used in Gas Insulated Switchgear installations are excluded from
    this guide. This Guide in no way replaces the manufacturer’s instruction manual
    which is to be used for safe and effective utilization of the circuit breaker.
    This Guide helps organize instruction manual information in a consistent and user
    friendly manner.
