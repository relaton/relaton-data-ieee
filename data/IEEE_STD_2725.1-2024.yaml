abstract:
- content: Requirements and guidelines for the design of radiofrequency (RF) brain
    imaging systems, to help protect subjects/users/patients from adverse effects
    from overexposure to RF electromagnetic energy, and from other electrical, mechanical,
    chemical, and biological hazards are specified by this standard. This standard
    is limited to brain imaging devices using a brain machine interface (BMI) that
    intentionally couples low-level RF electromagnetic energy, in the frequency range
    between 10 MHz and 20 GHz, into the human head using antennas or probes in direct
    contact with, or close proximity to, the human head.
