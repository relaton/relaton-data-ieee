abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides a set of guidelines that can be used
    by the operators of new start-up systems seeking guidance in developing manuals,
    methods, practices and procedures for the safe and effective maintenance of their
    Overhead Contact System (OCS), or by the maintenance organizations of existing
    well-established systems to amplify or refine their existing practices. This recommended
    practice provides general recommendations for performing maintenance work on dc
    OCS for transit systems. These recommendations are based on sound engineering
    principles, engineering safety considerations and field experience by many transit
    agencies. Included are technical explanations to cover certain testing of tools
    and equipment; field maintenance and care of tools and equipment; work methods
    for the maintenance of the OCS; and recommended safety practices and procedures
    for persons working in the vicinity of energized lines.
