abstract:
- content: This recommended practice addresses the activities of the creation, analysis,
    and sustainment of architectures of software-intensive systems, and the recording
    of such architectures in terms of architectural descriptions. A conceptual framework
    for architectural description is established. The content of an architectural
    description is defined. Annexes provide the rationale for key concepts and terminology,
    the relationships to other standards, and examples of usage.
