abstract:
- content: Requirements for assemblies of single-phase and three-phase, dead-front
    and live-front,pad-mounted, load-interrupter switches with expulsion, current-limiting,
    and other types of fuses in enclosures up to 38 kV rated maximum voltage are given.
    Definitions are given, and service conditions and ratings are discussed. Design
    tests, production tests, and construction requirements are included.
