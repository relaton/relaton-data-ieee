abstract:
- content: Outdoor ac substations, either conventional or gas-insulated, are covered
    in this guide. Distribution, transmission, and generating plant substations are
    also included. With proper caution,the methods described herein are also applicable
    to indoor portions of such substations, or to sub-stations that are wholly indoors.
    No attempt is made to cover the grounding problems peculiar to dc substations.
    A quantitative analysis of the effects of lightning surges is also beyond the
    scope of this guide.
