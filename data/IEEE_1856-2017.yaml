abstract:
- content: Information for the implementation of prognostics and health management
    (PHM) for electronic systems is described in this standard. A normative framework
    for classifying PHM capability and for planning the development of PHM for an
    electronic system or product is also described in this standard. Manufacturers
    and end users can use this standard for planning the appropriate prognostics and
    health management techniques to implement and the associated life cycle operations
    for the system of interest.
