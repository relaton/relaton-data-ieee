abstract:
- content: Provides designers and users with tests and procedures to assure that a
    liquid-scintillation counting system is producing reliable data. This standard
    does not cover the calculation of sample activity for quenched unknown samples,
    sample preparation, efficiency correlation, (quench correction) procedures, or
    identification of unknown radionuclides.
