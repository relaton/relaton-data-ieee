abstract:
- content: This standard is intended for quantifying the performance of camera-equipped
    mobile devices. There is an emphasis on metrics and procedures appropriate to
    the types of sensors, lenses, and signal processing routines present on such devices.
    It is not intended as a general image quality standard for photographs produced
    by high-end dedicated cameras, e.g. DSLRs. Metrics include spatial frequency response,
    color uniformity, chroma level, lateral chromatic displacement, local geometric
    distortion, texture blur, and visual noise.
