abstract:
- content: This standard adopts MPAI Technical Specification Version 2.1 as an IEEE
    Standard. The Moving Picture, Audio and Data Coding by Artificial Intelligence
    (MPAI) Technical Specification Context-based Audio Enhancement (CAE) Version 2.1
    collects use cases that improve the user experience of audio applications using
    technologies that act on the input audio content using context information. The
    coverage of MPAI-CAE use cases includes entertainment, communication, teleconfer-encing,
    gaming, post-production, restoration, etc., in a variety of contexts such as in
    the home, in the car, on the go, and in the studio. The technologies are specified
    as AI Workflows, AI Modules, and Data Types. The currently specified use cases
    are Emotion Enhan-ced Speech (EES), Audio Recording Preservation (ARP), Speech
    Restoration System (SSR), and Enhanced Audioconference Experience (EAE).
