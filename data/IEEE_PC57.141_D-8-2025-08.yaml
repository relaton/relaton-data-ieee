abstract:
- content: Power transformers are vital equipment in power systems. Winding deformation
    being the main cause for the decrease of short-circuit withstand and mechanical
    stability for transformers is shown by statistics and research. The vibration
    test involves the measurement and analysis of the vibration signals on the transformer
    tank surface, which is a method to detect, monitor, and evaluate the winding deformation
    of energized transformers. The execution and evaluation methodology of vibration
    tests, applicable for oil-immersed power transformers rated above 66 kV, are described
    by this guide.
