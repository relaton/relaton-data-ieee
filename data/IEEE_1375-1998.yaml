abstract:
- content: Guidance in the protection of stationary battery systems is provided. For
    the purposes of this guide, stationary battery systems include the battery and
    dc components to and including the first protective device downstream of the battery
    terminals. This guide does not set requirements; rather it presents a number of
    options to the dc system designer of the different types of stationary battery
    system protection available.
