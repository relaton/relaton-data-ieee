abstract:
- content: Parameters to be used in the identification of contact wires used in transit
    systems and electric railways and railroads are defined. The identification of
    contact wire by metallurgical content, electrical conductivity, and agency ownership
    is the intended use of this standard. This standard is not intended to replace
    or supersede existing identification standards using grooving but rather to simplify
    identification methods.
