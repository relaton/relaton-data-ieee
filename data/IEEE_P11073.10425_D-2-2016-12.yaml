abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of the communication between continuous
    glucose monitor (CGM) devices and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal computers,
    personal health appliances, set top boxes), in a manner that enables plug-and-play
    interoperability, is established in this standard. It leverages appropriate portions
    of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology and information models.
    It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth
    environments, restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability.
    This standard defines a common core of communication functionality of CGM devices.
    In this context, CGM refers to the measurement of the level of glucose in the
    body on a regular (typically 5 minute) basis through a sensor continuously attached
    to the person.
