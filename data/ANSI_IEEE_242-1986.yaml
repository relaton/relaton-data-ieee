abstract:
- content: The ANSI/IEEE Std 242-1986, the IEEE Buff Book, deals with the proper selection,
    application, and coordination of the components which constitute system protection
    for industrial plants and commercial buildings. System protection and coordination
    serve to minimize damage to a system and its components in order to limit the
    extent and duration of any service interruption occurring on any portion of the
    system. This recommended practice is for use at the system design stage as well
    as in modifying existing operations. It is arranged in a convenient step-by-step
    format. Complete information on protection and coordination principles designed
    to protect industrial and commercial power systems against any abnormalities which
    could reasonably be expected to occur in the course of system operation is presented.
