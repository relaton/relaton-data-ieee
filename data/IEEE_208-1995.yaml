abstract:
- content: The methods for measuring the resolution of camera systems are described.
    The primary application is for users and manufacturers to quantify the limit where
    fine detail contained in the original image is no longer reproduced by the camera
    system. The techniques described may also be used for laboratory measurements
    and for proof-of-performance specifications for a camera.
