abstract:
- content: 'Project scope: This guide covers the application of surge voltage protective
    equipment to AC rotating machines rated 1000 volts and greater. The guide does
    not cover motors applied in solid-state switched adjustable speed drives. Part
    1 covers the insulation surge withstand strength of motors and generators with
    windings having form-wound multi-turn coils and the application of surge protection
    to form-wound multi-turn coil motors. Part 2 will cover application of surge protection
    to generators with form-wound multi-turn coils, plus insulation surge withstand
    strength and surge protection of single-turn coil generators and motors. Project
    purpose: This guide is intended to aid engineers at all levels of surge protection
    knowledge in deciding whether particular machines should have surge protection.
    The guide may be used in estimating the surge withstand capability and switching
    surge exposure of ac rotating machinery in usual, not extreme exposure, installations.
    The manufacturer should be contacted for specific insulation surge voltage withstand
    values for machinery of particular interest or importance. For those machines
    which should be protected, the purpose is to provide guidance in selecting and
    applying the protective devices. A simple look-up method using tables and a graph
    is provided for quick estimation of surge rise times and surge voltage levels,
    and for general use where accuracies in the order of 10% to 15% are acceptable.
    This method is based on single-phase analysis, neglecting the influence of ground
    mode surge propagation. A more complex method is provided by formulas to model
    the three-phase and ground mode propagation. The formulas can be used with calculators
    or personal computers.'
