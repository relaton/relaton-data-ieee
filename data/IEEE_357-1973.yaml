abstract:
- content: The physical means by which electric energy is received from the electric
    utility is known as an electric interconnection. The primary elements include
    transmission or distribution circuits, transformers, and switching devices in
    the form of circuit breakers, fuses, and isolating disconnecting switches. The
    secondary elements include sensing devices to obtain information to operate the
    primary equipment intelligently, and relays to initiate removal of equipment from
    service automatically and quickly when an electric fault or disturbance occurs.
    It is important to remember that the physical laws of nature which govern the
    operating behavior of an electric system do not recognize defined lines of electric
    facility ownership. Thus for a well-engineered interconnection it is mandatory
    that problems in electric-system protection be studied and analyzed critically
    without regard to ownership. From the viewpoint of service reliability and service
    continuity, it is basic to understand that the best conceived, best implemented
    relaying system is no substitute for an adequately designed power system; and,
    indeed, inadequately applied protective relaying will contribute to inadequate
    and unsatisfactory performance of an otherwise well-designed electric system.
    In considering a new installation, or changes to an existing arrangement, it is
    very important that protective relaying and safety be given careful attention
    in the early stages of planning.
