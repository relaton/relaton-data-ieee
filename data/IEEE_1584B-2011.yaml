abstract:
- content: Techniques for designers and facility operators to apply in determining
    the arc-flash hazard distance and the incident energy to which employees could
    be exposed during their work on or near electrical equipment are provided in IEEE
    Std 1584-2002 and IEEE Std 1584a-2004. Changes in Clause 4 (the analysis process),
    based on the experience of persons who have conducted many of these studies, are
    provided in this amendment.
