abstract:
- content: The scope of this report is the exploration of ethics-related issues to
    support the development, design, and deployment of XR applications in the war,
    conflict, and defense domain and the aim is to initiate expert-driven, multidiscipline
    analysis of the evolving XR Ethics requirements, with a vision to propose solutions,
    technologies, and standards in future updates. The set of recommendations within
    this report will hopefully contribute to the industry conceptualization of socio-technological
    issues, highlight concreted recommendations, and lay the groundwork for future
    technical-standardization activities.
