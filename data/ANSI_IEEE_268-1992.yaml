abstract:
- content: Guidance for the application of the modernized metric system in the United
    States is given. Known as the International System of Units (SI), the system is
    intended as a basis for worldwide standardization of measurement units. Information
    is included on SI, a limited list of non-SI units recognized for use with SI units,
    and a list of conversion factors from non-SI to SI units, together with general
    guidance on proper style and usage.
