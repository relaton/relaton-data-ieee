abstract:
- content: This standard presents the combined efforts of IEEE Subcommittee P287 that
    reflect the knowledge and experience of leading specialists in the development
    and measurement of precision coaxial connectors from dc to 110 GHz. It presents
    minimum performance requirements to standardize both hermaphroditic and pin- and
    socket-type connectors. It provides recommended electrical and mechanical test
    procedures for general and laboratory precision connectors. A bibliography provides
    a list of pertinent references for measurement techniques used in determining
    electrical, mechanical, and dimensional parameters for coaxial connectors.
