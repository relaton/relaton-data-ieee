abstract:
- content: 'Ethernet local area network operation is specified for selected speeds
    of operation from 1 Mb/s to 100 Gb/s using a common media access control (MAC)
    specification and management information base (MIB). The Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) MAC protocol specifies shared medium
    (half duplex) operation, as well as full duplex operation. Speed specific Media
    Independent Interfaces (MIIs) allow use of selected Physical Layer devices (PHY)
    for operation over coaxial, twisted pair or fiber optic cables, or electrical
    backplanes. System considerations for multisegment shared access networks describe
    the use of Repeaters which are defined for operational speeds up to 1000 Mb/s.
    Local Area Network (LAN) operation is supported at all speeds. Other specified
    capabilities include: various PHY types for access networks, PHYs suitable for
    metropolitan area network applications, and the provision of power over selected
    twisted pair PHY types.'
