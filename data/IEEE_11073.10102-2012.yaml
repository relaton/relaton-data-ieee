abstract:
- content: The base IEEE 11073-10101 Nomenclature is extended by this standard to
    provide support for ECG annotation terminology. It may be used either in conjunction
    with other IEEE 11073 standards (e.g., ISO/IEEE 11073-10201:2001) or independently
    with other standards. The major subject areas addressed by the nomenclature include
    ECG beat annotations, wave component annotations, rhythm annotations, and noise
    annotations. Additional &#x201C;global&#x201D; and &#x201C;per-lead&#x201D; numeric
    observation identifiers, ECG lead systems, and additional ECG lead identifiers
    also are defined.
