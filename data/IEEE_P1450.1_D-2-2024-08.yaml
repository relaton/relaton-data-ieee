abstract:
- content: An interface between digital test generation tools and test equipment is
    provided by Standard Test Interface Language (STIL). Extensions to the test interface
    language (contained in this standard) are defined that facilitate the use of the
    language in the design environment and facilitate the use of the language for
    large designs encompassing subdesigns with reusable patterns.
