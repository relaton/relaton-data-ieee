abstract:
- content: The detection and location of acoustic emissions (AEs) from partial discharges
    (PDs) and other sources in liquid-insulated power transformers and reactors are
    covered in this guide. A means of associating the relative magnitude and position
    of PDs and other sources with the acoustic signals obtained by strategically located
    transducers is provided.
