abstract:
- content: Guidance for the application of ac high-voltage circuit breakers for shunt
    reactor switching is provided. Overvoltage generation for the three cases of shunt
    reactors being directly grounded, ungrounded, or grounded through a neutral reactor
    is addressed in terms of derivation and limitation methods. Circuit breaker specification
    for the purpose and the use of laboratory test results to predict field performance
    is also covered by this guide.
