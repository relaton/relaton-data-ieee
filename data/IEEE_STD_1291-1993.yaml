abstract:
- content: 'This guide defines methods of measuring partial discharges that may occur
    in energized power switchgear apparatus in flaws, voids, and interfaces of nonself-restoring
    insulation that may then result in dielectric failure of the switchgear. Guidance
    on instrumentation and calibration technique is also given. The following types
    of equipment are included: high-voltage fuses, high-voltage switches, high-voltage
    circuit breakers, reclosers and sectionalizers, and switchgear assemblies.<<ETX>>'
