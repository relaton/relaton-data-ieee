abstract:
- content: Environmental testing requirements are defined for communications networking
    devices to be installed in transmission and distribution facilities. This standard
    establishes a common reproducible basis for designing and evaluating devices utilizing
    radio frequency (RF) up to 6 GHz, power line communications, and broadband over
    power line (BPL) technologies. It also requires immunity to five IEC electromagnetic
    compatibility standards for which there are no IEEE equivalent standards. This
    standard is an extension to IEEE 1613-2009 Standard Environmental and Testing
    Requirements for Communications Networking Devices Installed in Electric Power
    Substations and its Amendment 1 - 2011.
