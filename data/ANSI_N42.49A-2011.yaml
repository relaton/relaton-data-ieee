abstract:
- content: This standard establishes minimum performance criteria and test requirements
    for four categories of alarming electronic radiation detectors used to manage
    exposure by alerting the emergency responders when they are exposed to photon
    radiation. The instruments provide rapid and clear indication of the level of
    radiation exposure and/or exposure rate and readily recognizable alarms. The alarms
    are both audible and visual, and distinguishable between exposure rate and exposure.
