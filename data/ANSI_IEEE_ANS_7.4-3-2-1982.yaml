abstract:
- content: This standard establishes application criteria for programmable digital
    computer systems in safety systems of nuclear power generating stations. These
    criteria are established to provide a means for promoting safe practices for design
    and evaluation of safety system performance and reliability. However, adhering
    to these will not necessarily fully establish the adequacy of any safety system
    s functional performance and reliability; nonetheless, omission of any of these
    criteria will, in most instances, be an indication of safety system inadequacy.
    This standard does not provide specific requirements for preparation or content
    of software quality assurance plans.
