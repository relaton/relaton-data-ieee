abstract:
- content: This standard is the first in the 1547 series of interconnection standards
    and is a benchmark milestone demonstrating the open consensus process for standards
    development. Traditionally, utility electric power systems (EPS--grid or utility
    grid) were not designed to accommodate active generation and storage at the distribution
    level. As a result, there are major issues and obstacles to an orderly transition
    to using and integrating distributed power resources with the grid. The lack of
    uniform national interconnection standards and tests for interconnection operation
    and certification, as well as the lack of uniform national building, electrical,
    and safety codes, are understood. IEEE Std 1547 and its development demonstrate
    a model for ongoing success in establishing additional interconnection agreements,
    rules, and standards, on a national, regional, and state level. IEEE Std 1547
    has the potential to be used in federal legislation and rule making and state
    public utilities commission (PUC) deliberations, and by over 3000 utilities in
    formulating technical requirements for interconnection agreements for distributed
    generators powering the electric grid. This standard focuses on the technical
    specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection itself. It provides requirements
    relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance
    of the interconnection. It includes general requirements, response to abnormal
    conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements
    for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests.
    The stated requirements are universally needed for interconnection of distributed
    resources (DR), including synchronous machines, induction machines, or power inverters/converters
    and will be sufficient for most installations.
