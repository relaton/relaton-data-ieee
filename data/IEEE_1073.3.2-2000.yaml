abstract:
- content: Replaced by ISO/IEC 11073-30200:2004. A connection-oriented transport profile
    and physical layer suitable for medical device communications in legacy devices
    is established. Communications services and protocols consis-tent with specifications
    of the Infrared Data Association are defined. These communication services and
    protocols are optimized for use in patient-connected bedside medical devices.
