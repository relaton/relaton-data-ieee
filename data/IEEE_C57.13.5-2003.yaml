abstract:
- content: This standard covers the test requirements, including test sequences, criteria,
    methods, and documentation for instrument transformers of 115 kV nominal system
    and above. It is to be used a supplement to IEEE STD C57.13-1993. Besides the
    provision of up-to-date test requirements, the trial-use standard also provides
    test procedures that were not adequately covered in the previous standard.
