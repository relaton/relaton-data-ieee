abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to outline definitions, terminology, voltage
    ratings, and test requirements for cable joints for all types of insulated ac
    power cable rated in preferred voltage steps from 2.5 to 500kV. No attempt is
    made in this standard to cover design details, dimensional data, or installation
    instructions normally supplied by the designer. Cable joints are made or assembled
    on the jobsite with the components supplied, and therefore, it is essential that
    all drawings and instructions be followed carefully by trained personnel in order
    that the actual field joints develop the characteristics established by design
    tests on similar joints.
