abstract:
- content: The material in this recommended practice was originally published in the
    first edition of IEEE Std 1015™ (IEEE Blue Book™) in 1997 and is an update of
    the material in Chapter 1 through Chapter 4, and Chapter 6 of the 2006 edition.
    It also encompasses the material in Chapter 7 of IEEE Std 242™-2001 (IEEE Buff
    Book™). Information for selecting the proper circuit breaker for a particular
    application is provided. Application engineers are aided in specifying the type
    of circuit breaker, ratings, trip functions, and accessories. Circuit breakers
    for special applications, e.g., instantaneous only and switches are discussed.
    In addition, information for applying circuit breakers at different locations
    in the power system and for protecting specific components is provided.
