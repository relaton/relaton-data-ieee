abstract:
- content: Various good practices that will enable users to improve their ability
    to assemble and erect self-supporting and guyed steel or aluminum lattice and
    tubular steel structures are presented. Construction considerations after foundation
    installation, and up to the conductor stringing operation, are also covered. The
    guide focuses on the design and construction considerations for material delivery,
    assembly and erection of metal transmission structures, and the installation of
    insulators and hardware. This guide is intended to be used as a reference source
    for parties involved in the ownership, design, and construction of transmission
    structures.
