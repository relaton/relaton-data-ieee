abstract:
- content: Practical methods for making laboratory measurements of electroacoustic
    characteristics of analog and digital telephones, handsets, and headsets are presented.
    The methods may also be applicable to a wide variety of other communications equipment,
    including cordless, wireless, and mobile communications devices. Measurement results
    may be used to evaluate these devices on a standardized basis. Application is
    in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 8500 Hz.
