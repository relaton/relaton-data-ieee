abstract:
- content: 'This document was developed to assist users of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2023
    or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 to acquire or supply information for users as part of the
    system or life cycle processes. It defines the documentation process from the
    acquirers standpoint and the supplier''s standpoint. This document covers the
    requirements for information items used in the acquisition of user documentation
    products: the acquisition plan, information product specification, statement of
    work, request for proposals, and the proposal. It provides an overview of the
    information management processes which may require acquisition and supply of system
    or software user documentation products and services. It addresses the preparation
    of requirements for user documentation. These requirements are central to the
    user documentation specification and statement of work. It includes requirements
    for primary document outputs of the acquisition and supply process: the request
    for proposal and the proposal for user documentation products and services. This
    document is independent of the software tools that may be used to produce documentation,
    and applies to both printed documentation and onscreen documentation. Its guidance
    is applicable to user documentation for systems including hardware as well as
    software.'
