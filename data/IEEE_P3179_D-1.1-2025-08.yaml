abstract:
- content: The relevant contents regarding the construction 1 of digital mines is
    systematically and comprehensively expounded upon by this recommended practice.
    In order to provide standardized suggestions, references, and guidance for the
    scientific construction and efficient operation of digital mines, the rational
    architecture around the business process of digital mines is elaborately planned,
    the key points of the digitalization of geological resources and geographical
    environment in environmental digitalization are deeply analyzed, each element
    of the information infrastructure is standardized, the specific requirements of
    multiple management function modules are comprehensively covered, and formulating
    norms for the internal integration and external integration of mine enterprise
    systems is focused on.
