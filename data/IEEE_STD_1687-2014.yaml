abstract:
- content: A methodology for accessing instrumentation embedded within a semiconductor
    device, without defining the instruments or their features themselves, via the
    IEEE 1149.1(TM) test access port (TAP) and/or other signals, is described in this
    standard. The elements of the methodology include a hardware architecture for
    the on-chip network connecting the instruments to the chip pins, a hardware description
    language to describe this network, and a software language and protocol for communicating
    with the instruments via this network.
