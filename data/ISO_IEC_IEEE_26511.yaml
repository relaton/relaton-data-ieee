abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 26511:2012 specifies procedures for managing user documentation
    throughout the software life cycle. It applies to people or organizations producing
    suites of documentation, to those undertaking a single documentation project,
    and to documentation produced internally, as well as to documentation contracted
    to outside service organizations. It provides an overview of the software documentation
    and information management processes, and also presents aspects of portfolio planning
    and content management that user documentation managers apply. It covers management
    activities in starting a project, including setting up procedures and specifications,
    establishing infrastructure, and building a team. It includes examples of roles
    needed on a user documentation team. It addresses measurements and estimates needed
    for management control, and the use of supporting processes such as change management,
    schedule and cost control, resource management, and quality management and process
    improvement. It includes requirements for key documents produced for user documentation
    management, including documentation plans and documentation management plans.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 26511:2012 is independent of the software tools that may be used
    to produce or manage documentation, and applies to both printed documentation
    and on-screen documentation. Much of its guidance is applicable to user documentation
    for systems including hardware as well as software.
