abstract:
- content: Standard measurement and test procedures are established for wide-bandgap
    semiconductor detectors such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), cadmium-zinc-telluride
    (CdZnTe), and mercuric iodide (HgI2) that can be used at room temperature for
    the detection and quantitative characterization of gamma-rays, X-rays, and charged
    particles. Standard terminology and descriptions of the principal features of
    the detectors are included. Included in this standard is an annex on interfering
    electromagnetic noise, which is a factor in such measurements.
