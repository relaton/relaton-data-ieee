abstract:
- content: This guide has been written as an applications manual for engineers and
    authors who will be writing test procedures in ATLAS (Abbreviated Test Language
    for All Systems). It is not intended to be a substitute for an instruction manual
    in the ATLAS language, but, rather, a practical extension to such a manual. The
    purpose is to provide principles of good practice in the use of ATLAS for the
    writing of test procedures.
