- content: 'This IEEE Standards product is part of the family on Software Engineering.
    This guide provides the underlying concepts and motivation for establishing a
    measurement process for reliable software, utilizing IEEE Std 982.1-1988, IEEE
    Standard Dictionary of Measures to Produce Reliable Software. It contains information
    necessary for application of measures to a project. It includes guidance for the
    following: applying product and process measures throughout the software life
    cycle, providing the means for continual self-assessment and reliability improvement;
    optimizing the development of reliable software, beginning at the early development
    stages with respect to constraints such as cost and schedule; maximizing the reliability
    of software in its actual use environment during the operation and maintenance
    phases; and developing the means to manage reliability in the same manner that
    cost and schedule are managed. The guide is intended for design, development,
    evaluation (e.g., auditing or procuring agency), and maintenance personnel; software
    quality and software reliability personnel; and operations and acquisition support
    managers. It is organized to provide input to the planning process for reliability
    management.'
