abstract:
- content: The interdisciplinary tasks that are required throughout a system's life
    cycle to transform stakeholder needs, requirements, and constraints into a system
    solution are defined. This standard is intended to guide the development of systems
    for commercial, government, military, and space applications. The information
    applies to a project within an enterprise that is responsible for developing a
    product design and establishing the life cycle infrastructure needed to provide
    for life cycle sustainment.
