abstract:
- content: This American National Standard is a revision and expansion of USA Standard
    Graphic Symbols forElectrical and Electronics Diagrams, Y32.2-1967.A large number
    of new symbols has been added. While the major additions are in the areas ofantennas,
    transmission path, thermal relays, VHF/UHF/SHF circuit devices, and semiconductor
    devices, all sections have some new or revised items. New sections have been added
    to cover graphic symbols for special-purpose maintenance diagrams, analog computer
    symbols (formerly in IEEE Standard166), also equipment and station symbols for
    system diagrams, maps and charts. For convenienceof users, the class letters used
    to form reference designations (formerly in ANSI Y32.16) have nowbeen included
    in a new section of Y32.2. In this revision the symbols are slightly larger than
    in Y32.2-1967 edition, resulting in improved readability. A revised edition of
    the large symbol chart included with the Y32.2-1967 edition will be available
    separately to complement the new edition.All of the symbols are designed so that
    their connection points fall on a modular grid. This shouldhelp those who use
    a grid basis for the preparation of diagrams. By proper enlargement of the symbolthe
    usual coordinate-grid sizes can be matched.
