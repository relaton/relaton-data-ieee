abstract:
- content: Described in this guide are methods to evaluate and test the electrical
    performance of energy saving devices (ESDs). Measurement methods that focus on
    monitoring the power consumed or generated by the observed load or generator without
    the ESD connected into the circuit and with the ESD connected and energized into
    the circuit are described. Detailed protocols describe step-by-step the testing
    circuits, the type and accuracy of evaluation instrumentation, and the order of
    the test measurements. Special emphasis is given to sources of measurement errors
    due to incorrect connection of instrumentation, inadequate instrumentation, or
    incorrect interpretation of results. Contained in Annex B are practical examples
    and explanations of the physical mechanisms of phenomena that may cause errors.
    This guide applies to any electrically connected ESD controlling electrical power
    delivered from a source and powering an electrical load. While an independent,
    certified testing laboratory might be contracted to perform ESD testing, the intent
    of this standard is to provide guidance to those involved with ESDs wishing to
    obtain accurate and objective data to aid in evaluating ESD performance.
