abstract:
- content: The recommended block-transfer algorithms are discussed, and those given
    in the basic CAMAC specification are described. These algorithms are well established
    and are supported by existing hardware. Some new algorithms are then discussed.
    Compatibility, hardware design, and software considerations are addressed.
