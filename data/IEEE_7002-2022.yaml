abstract:
- content: The requirements for a systems/software engineering process for privacy-oriented
    considerations regarding products, services, and systems utilizing employee, customer,
    or other external user’s personal data are defined by this standard. Organizations
    and projects that are developing and deploying products, systems, processes, and
    applications that involve personal information are candidate users of the IEEE
    Std 7002&#8482; standard. Specific procedures, diagrams, and checklists are provided
    for users of the IEEE Std 7002 standard to perform conformity assessments on their
    specific privacy practices. Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) are described as
    a tool for both identifying where privacy controls and measures are needed and
    for confirming they are in place.
