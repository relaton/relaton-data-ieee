abstract:
- content: Safe and reliable methods for the electrical protection of telecommunication
    facilities serving electric supply locations through the use of metallic wire-line
    components in part of thetelecommunication circuit and optical fiber systems in
    the remainder of the telecommunicationcircuit are presented in this standard.
    Hybrid applications have an equipment junction betweenthe metallic wire-line and
    the fiber cable, i.e., a wire-linefiber cable junction (CFJ).
