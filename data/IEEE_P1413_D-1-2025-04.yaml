abstract:
- content: This standard covers the framework for the reliability prediction for electronic
    hardware. This standard identifies the required elements for an understandable
    and credible reliability prediction with information to evaluate the prediction
    results and to assess their usability for the intended application. A reliability
    prediction generated according to this standard would have sufficient information
    concerning inputs, assumptions, data sources, methodologies, and uncertainties
    so that the risk associated with using the prediction results can be considered.
    This document does not provide instructions for how to perform a reliability prediction
    and does not make recommendations about the use of a specific methodology.
