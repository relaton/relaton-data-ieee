abstract:
- content: Digital recorders and digital oscilloscopes used for measurements during
    tests with high-impulse voltages and high-impulse currents are considered. Terms
    specifically related to the digital recorders used for monitoring high-voltage
    and high-current impulse tests are defined. The performance characteristics for
    such recorders, necessary to ensure their compliance with the requirements for
    high-voltage and for high-current impulse tests, are specified. The tests and
    procedures that are necessary to show that these performance characteristics are
    within those specified limits are indicated.
