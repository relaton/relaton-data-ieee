abstract:
- content: A digital interface for connecting multiple physically separated transducers
    to a single processor over a single pair of wires. The interface can support both
    asynchronous and isochronous data transfers. Several Transducer Electronic Data
    Sheets (TEDS) and their data formats are described. An electrical interface, channel
    identification protocols, time synchronization protocols, read and write logic
    functions to access the TEDS, and transducers with a wide variety of attributes
    are defined. This standard does not specify signal conditioning, signal conversion,
    or how an application uses the TEDS data.
