abstract:
- content: Basic requirements, direction, and methods for qualifying Class lE connection
    assemblies for service in nuclear power generating stations and otherre nuclear
    facilities are provided in this standard. These requirements include connectors,
    terminations, and environmental seals in combination with related cables or wires
    as assemblies. Qualification of cable with connectors to this standard does not
    replace qualification to IEEE Std 383(TM)-2015. This standard does not apply to
    containment electric penetrations, fire stops, in-line splices, components for
    service within the reactor vessel, or fiber optic connectors. (Refer to IEEE Std
    1682(TM)-2011.) The qualification requirements in this standard, when met, demonstrate
    and document the ability of the equipment to perform safety function(s) under
    applicable service conditions (including design basis events) reducing the risks
    of common cause equipment failures. This standard does not provide environmental
    stress levels and performance requirements.
