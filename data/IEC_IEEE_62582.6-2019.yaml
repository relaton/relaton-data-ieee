abstract:
- content: This IEC/IEEE standard specifically focuses on insulation resistance measurement
    methods for monitoring of the dielectric condition of instrumentation and control
    cables during simulation of design basis events. This IEC/IEEE standard is the
    sixth part of the IEC/IEEE 62582-series. It contains detailed descriptions of
    condition monitoring based on insulation resistance measurements.
