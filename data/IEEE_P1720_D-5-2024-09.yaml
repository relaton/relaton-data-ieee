abstract:
- content: This document describes near-field test practices for the measurement of
    antenna properties. It is written for the person responsible or otherwise involved
    in operating the test system. It recommends procedures for testing and documenting
    the quality of the near-field system, for calibration of the system, for carrying
    out the antenna measurements, and for delivering the measurement data in a useful
    format to the end user. The document defines useful antenna metrics, describes
    different types of test ranges with a brief introduction to the theory and equipment
    used. It reviews methods of characterizing and operating antenna measurement ranges.
    Issues related to uncertainty analysis, anechoic chamber layout, probe calibration,
    full probe compensation, echo reduction techniques and use of non-orthogonal expansion
    functions in the Near-Field to Far-Field transformation are also discussed.
