abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Jan 15, 2001. Firmware is the read-only-memory
    (ROM)-based software that controls a computer between the time it is turned on
    and the time the primary operating system takes control of the machine. Firmware''s
    responsibilities include testing and initializing the hardware, determining the
    hardware configuration, loading (or booting) the operating system, and providing
    interactive debugging facilities in case of faulty hardware or software. The core
    requirements and practices specified by IEEE Std 1275-1994 must be supplemented
    by system-specific requirements to form a complete specification for the firmware
    for a particular system. This standard establishes such additional requirements
    pertaining to the bus architecture defined by the IEEE Futurebus+¨ standards:
    ISO/IEC 10857: 1994[ANSI/IEEE Std 896.1, 1994 Edition], Information technology-Microprocessor
    systems-Futurebus -Logical protocol specifications; and IEEE Std 896.2-1991: IEEE
    Standard for Futurebus -Physical Layer and Profile Specification.'
