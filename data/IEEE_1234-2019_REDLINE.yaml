abstract:
- content: Test and measurements, which are performed on shielded power cables to
    identify the location of a fault, are described. Whenever possible, the limitations
    of a particular test and measurement to locate a fault are provided and recommendations
    are made regarding specialized fault-locating techniques. A fault characterization
    chart is included as an aid to select a fault-locating technique.
