abstract:
- content: Terminologies and a framework for percutaneous and non-fluoroscopic (PAN)
    technology, which is conducted by ultrasound in a percutaneous cardiovascular
    interventional therapy, are established in this standard. Communication and cooperation
    with various stakeholders under a unified terminology and framework to overcome
    differences and to make technology more reliable, efficient, and safer, is promoted
    by this standard. The standardization of PAN technology will help scale up solution,
    satisfy people’s needs and promote healthcare services sustainable.
