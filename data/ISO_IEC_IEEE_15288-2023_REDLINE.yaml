abstract:
- content: This document establishes a common framework of process descriptions for
    describing the life cycle of systems created by humans, defining a set of processes
    and associated terminology from an engineering viewpoint. These processes can
    be applied to systems of interest, their system elements, and to system of systems.
    Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the stages of a system's
    life cycle. This is accomplished through the involvement of stakeholders, with
    the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction.
