abstract:
- content: ANSI C63.4-1991, American National Standard Methods of Measurement of Radio-Noise
    Emissions From Low-Voltage Electrical and Electronic Equipment in the Range of
    9 kHz to 40 GHz, sets forth uniform methods of measurement of radio noise emitted
    from low-voltage electrical and electronic equipment, including digital and other
    information technology equipment (ITE), in the frequency range of 9 kHz to 40
    GHz. Methods for the measurement of radiated and power-line-conducted radio noise
    are covered and may be applied to any such equipment unless otherwise specified
    by individual equipment requirements.
