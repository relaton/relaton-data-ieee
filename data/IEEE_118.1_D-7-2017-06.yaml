abstract:
- content: This standard provides continuation and further development of previous
    synchrophasor standards,notably the IEEE C37.118 series. It defines synchrophasor,
    frequency, and rate of change offrequency (ROCOF) measurements as used in this
    technology. These definitions are in agreementwith most research on and analysis
    of dynamic electric power system measurements, but may differfrom those given
    in other contexts. Function and performance requirements are given forsynchrophasor
    measurements. Tests, evaluation criteria, and error limits are provided to determinecompliance
    with the requirements.
