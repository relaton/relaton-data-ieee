abstract:
- content: Procedures are given for testing amplifier and preamplifier systems with
    linear pulse-shaping networks for use with semiconductor, scintillation, and proportional
    detectors in the spectroscopy of ionizing radiation. The object is to provide
    a common language and methodology for users and manufacturers of pulse-amplifier
    systems. The emphasis in the methods of measurement is to enhance sensitivity
    and improve accuracy by working around the limitations of the test instruments,
    particularly oscilloscopes that have only a visual display for readout. A technique
    is used where possible, thereby reducing basic errors to the inaccuracy of precision
    resistors.
