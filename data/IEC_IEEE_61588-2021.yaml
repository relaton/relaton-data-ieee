abstract:
- content: In this standard, a protocol is defined that provides precise synchronization
    of clocks in packet-based networked systems. Synchronization of clocks can be
    achieved in heterogeneous systems that include clocks of different inherent precision,
    resolution, and stability. The protocol supports synchronization accuracy and
    precision in the sub-microsecond range with minimal network and local computing
    resources. Customization is supported by means of profiles. The protocol includes
    default profiles that permit simple systems to be installed and operated without
    the need for user management. Sub-nanosecond time transfer accuracy can be achieved
    in a properly designed network.
