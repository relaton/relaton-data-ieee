abstract:
- content: This standard defines physical layer and data link layer specifications
    for power supply and communication over power lines from a DC Power Source to
    multiple DC loads as specified in IEEE P2847(TM)/D4 2021. Each receiver has its
    own physical address and is connected to the transmitter through a pair of power
    lines in a multi-drop bus or tree topology. The transmitter sends the DC Power
    and the electric signals corresponding to the communication packets including
    the control command/data for controlling the DC loads and the target address through
    the power line by electrically changing the voltage of the wires. Each receiver
    supplies power to the DC loads with the transmitted and voltage-flattened DC power.
    Each receiver decodes the control command/data and address from electric signals
    on the power line and uses them for the connected DC loads control if the addresses
    match. The standard is in compliance with known Electro-Magnetic Compatibility
    (EMC) regulations
