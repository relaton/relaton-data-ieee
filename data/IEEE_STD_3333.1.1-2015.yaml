abstract:
- content: As the demand and supply for 3D technologies grows, the development of
    accurate quality-assessment techniques shall be used to develop the 3D display
    device and signal-processing engine industries. The underlying principles and
    statistical characteristics of 3D contents based on the human visual system (HVS)
    are described in this standard. In addition, a reliable 3D subjective assessment
    methodology that covers the characteristics of human perception, display mechanism,
    and the viewing environment is introduced in this standard.
