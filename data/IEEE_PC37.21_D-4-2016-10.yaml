abstract:
- content: Ratings, construction, and testing of dead-front control switchboards containing,
    but not limited to, devices such as switches, control devices, instrumentation,
    metering, monitoring, alarms, annunciators, protective and auxiliary relays, and
    regulating devices and accessories are covered in this standard. It includes,
    but is not specifically limited to, switchboards for the control and protection
    of apparatus used for or associated with power generation, conversion, transmission,
    and distribution. Types of switchboards may include control, vertical, dead-front,
    enclosed, dual, or duplex switchboards. Other construction types include control
    desks, consoles, benchboards, dual or duplex benchboards, fixed rack, cabinet,
    and swing rack cabinets. It does not apply to industrial controls, communication
    equipment, switchboards for use on board ships, or Class 1E switchboards for use
    in nuclear generating stations.
