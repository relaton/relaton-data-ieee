abstract:
- content: This standard provides qualification test procedures for type testing cable
    penetration fire stops when mounted in rated fire barriers. In the course of construction
    of all types of buildings, cables in raceways penetrate barriers such as walls,
    floors, or floor-ceiling assemblies of that building. If these barriers are rated
    as fire resistive barriers, the penetrations should be as resistant to fire as
    required of the barriers. Thus, in order to test the penetration and rate it,
    the penetration should be mounted in a rated wall, floor, or floor ceiling assembly
    as it would be used in practice and the combination exposed to the same standard
    fire as used for the wall, floor, or floor-ceiling assembly.
