abstract:
- content: Replaced by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011. The content and qualities of a good
    software requirements specification (SRS) are described and several sample SRS
    outlines are presented. This recommended practice is aimed at specifying requirements
    of software to be developed but also can be applied to assist in the selection
    of in-house and commercial software products. Guidelines for compliance with IEEE/
    EIA12207.1- 1997 are also provided.
