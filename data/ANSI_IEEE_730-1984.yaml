abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to provide uniform, minimum acceptable
    requirements for preparation and content of Software Quality Assurance Plans (SQAP).
    In considering adoption of this standard, regulatory bodies should be aware that
    specific application of this standard may already be covered by one or more IEEE
    or ANSI standards documents relating to quality assurance, definitions, or other
    matters. It is not the purpose of IEEE Std 730 to supersede, revise or amend existing
    standards directed to specific industries or applications. This standard applies
    to the development and maintenance of critical software; for example, where failure
    could impact safety or cause large financial or social losses. For non-critical
    software, or for software already developed, a subset of the requirements of this
    standard may be applied. The existence of this standard should not be construed
    to prohibit additional content in a Software Quality Assurance Plan. An assessment
    should be made for the specific software product item to assure adequacy of coverage.
    Where this standard is invoked for a project engaged in producing several software
    items, the applicability of the standard should be specified for each of the software
    product items encompassed by the project.
