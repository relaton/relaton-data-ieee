abstract:
- content: A method for the sizing of nonfunctional software requirements is defined
    in this standard. It complements ISO/IEC 20926:2009, which defines a method for
    the sizing of functional user requirements. Non-functional categories for data
    operations, interface design, technical environment, and architecture software
    are included in this standard.Steps to determine and calculate the non-functional
    size are also included. Handling requirements involving both functional and non-functional
    requirements are explained in this standard, which also covers how to apply non-functional
    sizing estimates in terms of cost, project duration and quality, and considerations
    of software performance in terms of productivity and quality. The combination
    of functional and nonfunctional size should correspond to the total size necessary
    to produce the software. The functional size and non-functional size are orthogonal,
    and both are needed when sizing the software. The complementarity of the functional
    and the non-functional sizes, to avoid overlaps or gaps between the two size methods,
    are described in this standard. Calculating the implementation work effort and
    duration of the non-functional requirements is outside the scope of this standard.
