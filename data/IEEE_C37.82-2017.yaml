abstract:
- content: 'The methods and requirements for qualifying switchgear assemblies for
    indoor areas outside of the containment in nuclear power generating stations are
    described in this document. These assemblies include: metal-enclosed low-voltage
    power circuit breaker switchgear assemblies, as defined in IEEE Std C37.20.1&#8482;;
    metal-clad switchgear assemblies, as defined in IEEE Std C37.20.2&#8482;; metal-enclosed
    bus, as defined in IEEE Std C37.23&#8482;; and metal-enclosed interrupter switchgear
    assemblies, as defined in IEEE Std C37.20.3&#8482;.'
