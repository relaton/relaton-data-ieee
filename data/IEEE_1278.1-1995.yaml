abstract:
- content: Data messages, known as protocol data units (PDUs), that are exchanged
    on a network between simulation applications are defined. These PDUs are for interactions
    that take place within specified domains called protocol families, which include
    entity information interaction, warefare, logistics, simulation management, distributed
    emission regeneration, and radio communications.
