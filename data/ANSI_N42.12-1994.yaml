abstract:
- content: This standard establishes methods for performance testing, calibration,
    and usage of NaI(Tl) detector systems for the measurement of gamma ray emission
    rates of radionuclides; the assay for radioactivity; and the determination of
    gamma ray energies and intensities. It covers both energy calibration and efficiency
    calibration.
