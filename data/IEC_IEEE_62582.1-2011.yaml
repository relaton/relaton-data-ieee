abstract:
- content: This part of IEC/IEEE 62582 is the first part of the IEC/IEEE 62582 series
    of standards, containing background and guidelines for the application of methods
    for condition monitoring of electrical equipment important to safety of nuclear
    power plants. The detailed descriptions of the methods are given in the other
    parts, one part for each method. This part also includes some elements which are
    common to all methods.
