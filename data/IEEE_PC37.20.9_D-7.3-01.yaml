abstract:
- content: This standard covers metal-enclosed switchgear assemblies incorporating
    gas insulating systems containing, but not limited to, such devices as interrupter
    switches; selector switches; fuses; circuit breakers; control, instrumentation
    and metering devices; and protective equipment. It includes, but is not specifically
    limited to, equipment for the control and protection of apparatus used for distribution
    of electrical power.
