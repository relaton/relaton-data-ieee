abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207-2 provides the mapping expressing corresponding relations
    between software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and the processes
    in the previous edition ISO/IEC 12207:2008. These relations are demonstrated by
    means of mapping tables that show relationships between Process Outcomes, and
    Activities and Tasks in these both editions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. This mapping
    assists users of the ISO/IEC 12207:2008 edition to transition to using the ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207:2017 edition. This document will help users understand the differences between
    the reference processes and requirements of the two editions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207,
    and help the user to understand any potential gaps or process enhancements might
    be needed in seeking conformance to, and/or use of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. Also,
    this document provides to such users the mapping which helps to identify corresponding
    and compatible process outcomes, activities and tasks of processes for software
    systems in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.
