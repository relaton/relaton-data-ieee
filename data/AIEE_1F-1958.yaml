abstract:
- content: As is stated in AIEE No. 1, accelerated life tests are recommended to determine
    the probable life expectancy of electrical insulating materials and of complete
    insulation systems under different conditions of service. Recommended procedures
    for conducting life tests at various temperatures to accelerate insulation degradation
    are outlined in AIEE 1D and lE. AIEE publications Nos. 57, 65, 510 and 511 are
    examples of test procedures developed for this purpose. After life data from such
    tests have been obtained at different temperatures, the problem is to evaluate
    the resultant data so that the life expectancy of insulation can be estimated.
    For this purpose, life expectancy is considered as a function of temperature.
    The most probable form of this relationship, and its reliability, are determined
    by the statistical procedures outlined herein.
