abstract:
- content: The standard provides criteria for the design, testing, and maintenance
    of security system equipment for nuclear power generating stations. Such equipment
    includes permanently or temporarily installed systems, subsystems, and components
    used by the security force for physical protection of the station against security
    threats. It includes equipment for security-related detection, assessment, surveillance,
    access control, communication, and data acquisition.
