abstract:
- content: A Secure Device Identifier (DevID) is cryptographically bound to a device
    and supports authentication of the device’s identity. An Initial Device Identifier
    (IDevID) provide by the supplier of a device can be supplemented by Local Device
    Identifiers (LDevIDs) facilitating enrollment (provisioning of authentication
    and authorization credentials) by local network administrators. (The PDF of this
