abstract:
- content: This standard covers certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics
    and takes into consideration certain safety features of single-phase, 60 Hz, mineral-oil-immersed,
    self-cooled, padmounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers with high-voltage
    bushings. These transformers are rated 167 kVA and smaller, with high-voltages
    of 34500 GRD/19900 volts and below for operation between one phase and grounded
    neutral, and low-voltage of 240/120 volts. These transformers are generally used
    for step-down purposes from an underground primary cable supply. NOTE&#8212;Refer
    to latest federal regulations concerning polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminations
    in transformers.
