abstract:
- content: A non-industry-specific recommended practice for voltage sag and short
    interruption ride-through performance and compliance testing for all electrical
    and electronic equipment connected to low-voltage power systems that can experience
    malfunction or shutdown as a result of reductions in supply voltage lasting less
    than one minute is detailed in this document. Testing procedures and requirements
    for test equipment are clearly defined within this document to reflect this electrical
    environment, including single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase balanced and unbalanced
    voltage sags. Requirements for certification and test reporting, including characterization
    of voltage-sag ride-through equipment are also defined.
