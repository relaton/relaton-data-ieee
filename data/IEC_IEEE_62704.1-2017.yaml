abstract:
- content: This part of IEC/IEEE 62704 defines the methodology for the application
    of the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) technique when used for determining
    the peak spatial-average specific absorption rate (SAR) in the human body exposed
    to wireless communication devices with known uncertainty. It defines methods to
    validate the numerical model of the device under test (DUT) and to assess its
    uncertainty when used in SAR simulations. Moreover, it defines procedures to determine
    the peak spatial-average SAR in a cubical volume and to validate the correct implementation
    of the FDTD simulation software. The applicable frequency range is 30 MHz to 6
    GHz.
