abstract:
- content: An optional local medium access control (MAC) address space structure,
    known as the Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP), is provided in this amendment
    to IEEE Std 802&#174;-2014 in order to allow multiple administrations to coexist.
    This structure designates a range of local MAC addresses for protocols using a
    Company ID (CID) assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority. Another range of
    local MAC addresses is designated for assignment by administrators. The amendment
    recommends a range of local MAC addresses for use by IEEE 802&#174; protocols.(The
    PDF of this standard is available at no cost to you compliments of the IEEE GET
    program http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=8016707.
