abstract:
- content: This guide provides comprehensive test methods for the pantograph off-line
    and the reasonable evaluation for the performance of current collection system
    in high-speed railway. Model for the arcing erosion, as well as the off-line induced
    transient overvoltage and harmonics, which impact the onsite devices’ safety are
    included.
