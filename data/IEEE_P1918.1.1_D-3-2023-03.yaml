abstract:
- content: 'Haptic codecs for the data reduction of kinesthetic and tactile signals
    are described in this standard. Three types of codecs are presented in this document,
    including the no-delay kinesthetic codec (Part I), the delay-robust kinesthetic
    codec (Part II), and the tactile codec (Part III). Additionally, this document
    introduces handshaking and metadata exchange mechanisms for the exchange of the
    capabilities of haptic devices (Part IV). This standard also provides additional
    information (in informative annexes) for codec implementation and evaluation,
    such as the reference software and hardware setups for kinesthetic and tactile
    codecs, and cross-validation results. Additional Open Source content available
    here: https://opensource.ieee.org/haptic-codecs/kinesthetic/-/releases/0.1.0.'
