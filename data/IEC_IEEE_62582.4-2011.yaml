abstract:
- content: This part of IEC/IEEE 62582 specifies methods for condition monitoring
    of organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using
    oxidation induction techniques in the detail necessary to produce accurate and
    reproducible measurements. It includes the requirements for sample preparation,
    the measurement system and conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results.
    The different parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 are measurement standards, primarily for
    use in the management of ageing in initial qualification and after installation.
    Part 1 of IEC/IEEE 62582 includes requirements for the application of the other
    parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 and some elements which are common to all methods. Information
    on the role of condition monitoring in the qualification of equipment important
    to safety is found in IEEE Std 323.
