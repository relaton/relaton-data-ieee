abstract:
- content: Metal-enclosed (ME) bus assemblies for indoor and outdoor use are discussed
    in this standard. The types of assemblies covered are nonsegregated-phase bus,
    cable bus, segregated-phase bus, and isolated-phase bus. Rated maximum voltages
    of ac ME bus assemblies range from 1058 V through 38 kV with continuous-current
    ratings of 600 A through 26 000 A for self-cooled ratings and up to 50 000 A for
    forced-cooled ratings. Rated maximum voltage levels of dc ME bus assemblies range
    from 300 V through 3200 V with continuous-current ratings of 600 A through 15
    000 A. Service conditions, ratings, temperature limitations and classification
    of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements,
    test procedures, and application are discussed. A guide for calculating losses
    in isolated-phase bus is included.
