abstract:
- content: This is the first revision of this publication, which formalizes the work
    of the System Controls Subcommittee of the Power System Engineering Committee
    on the terminology for automatic generation control on electric power systems.
    The need for standard terminology in this field became apparent after a study
    of technical papers indicated that many authors were using different definitions
    for their terms. Requests for the standardization of terms were also received
    from the operating groups of the large interconnected power systems in this country
    and Canada. This is the first publication in English devoted specifically to the
    terminology used in automatic generation control.
