abstract:
- content: Wideband measurement of the apparent charge of partial discharges (PDs)
    that may occur in liquid-filled power transformers and shunt reactors excited
    by ac test voltages between 40 Hz and 400 Hz are discussed. The major components
    of the PD measuring circuit including the calibrator are specified in compliance
    with IEC 60270. The PD test procedure is described and recommendations for the
    evaluation of PD test results are presented.
