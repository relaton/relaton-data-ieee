abstract:
- content: 'The development and application of federated machine learning are facing
    the critical challenges of balancing the tradeoff among privacy, security, performance,
    and efficiency, how to realize supervision covering the whole life cycle, and
    how to get explainable results. Thus, trustworthy federated machine learning is
    proposed to solve the above problem. In this standard, a general view of framework
    for trustworthy federated machine learning is provided in four parts: a principle
    in trustworthy federated machine learning, requirements from the perspective of
    different principles and different federated machine learning participants, and
    methods to realize trustworthy federated machine learning. Also provided is guidance
    on how trustworthy federated machine learning is used in various scenarios.'
