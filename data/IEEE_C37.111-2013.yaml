abstract:
- content: This standard defines a common format for the data files and exchange medium
    needed the interchange of various types of fault, test, and simulation data. The
    rapid evolution and implementation of digital devices for fault and transient
    data recording and testing in the electric utility industry have generated the
    need for a standard format for the exchange of time sequence data. These data
    are being used with various devices to enhance and automate the analysis, testing,
    evaluation, and simulation of power systems and related protection schemes during
    fault and disturbance conditions. Since each source of data may use a different
    proprietary format, a common data format is necessary to facilitate the exchange
    of such data between applications. This will facilitate the use of proprietary
    data in diverse applications and allow users of one proprietary system to use
    digital data from other systems.
