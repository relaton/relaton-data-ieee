abstract:
- content: 'This voluntary consensus standard sets forth the requirements for power
    transformer application. This standard is intended to be used as a basis for performance,
    interchangeability, and safety of the equipment covered, and to assist in the
    proper selection of such equipment. This document is a product standard that covers
    certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics of 50 Hz and 60
    Hz, liquid-immersed power transformers and autotransformers. Such power transformers
    may be remotely or integrally associated with either primary switchgear or substations,
    or both, for step-down or step-up purposes and base rated as follows: 833 kVA
    and above single-phase, 750 kVA and above three-phase.This standard applies to
    all liquid-immersed power transformers and autotransformers that do not belong
    to the following types of apparatus: instrument transformers, step voltage and
    induction voltage regulators, arc-furnace transformers, rectifier transformers,
    specialty transformers, grounding transformers, mobile transformers, and mine
    transformers.'
