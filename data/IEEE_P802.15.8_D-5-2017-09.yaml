abstract:
- content: Physical layer (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) mechanisms are defined
    in this standard for wireless personal area networks (WPANs) peer aware communications
    (PAC) optimized for peer-to-peer and infrastructure-less communications with fully
    distributed coordination. PAC features include discovery for peer information
    without association, discovery signaling rate typically greater than 100 kb/s,
    discovery of the number of devices in the network, scalable data transmission
    rates typically up to 10 Mb/s, group communications with simultaneous membership
    in multiple groups typically up to 10, relative positioning, security, and operation
    in selected globally available unlicensed/licensed bands below 11 GHz capable
    of supporting these requirements.
