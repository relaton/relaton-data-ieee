abstract:
- content: Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are set
    forth, as well as certain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz, liquid-immersed,
    self-cooled, pad-mounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers. These
    transformers are rated 10 MVA and smaller, with the high-voltage limit of 34.5
    kV nominal system voltage and below, and with low-voltage limit of 15 kV nominal
    system voltage and below. This standard covers the connector, bushing, and terminal
    arrangements for radial or loop-feed systems. This standard does not cover the
    electrical and mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied
    with the transformer.
