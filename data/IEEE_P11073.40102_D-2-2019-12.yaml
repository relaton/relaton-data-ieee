abstract:
- content: This standard defines for Personal Health Devices (PHDs) and Point-of-Care
    Devices (PoCDs) application layer cybersecurity mitigation techniques for certain
    use cases or when certain criteria are met. The mitigation techniques are based
    on the extended Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) triad and are
    described generally to allow manufacturers to determine the most appropriate algorithms
    and implementations. Generic recommendations for a scalable information security
    toolbox appropriate for PHDs/PoCDs interfaces are specified. A mapping of this
    standard to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity
    framework and ISO/IEC 80001-2-2 is defined
