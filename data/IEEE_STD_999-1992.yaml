abstract:
- content: The use of serial digital transmission by supervisory control and data
    acquisition (SCADA) systems having geographically dispersed terminals is addressed.
    These types of systems typically utilize dedicated communication channels, such
    as private microwave channels or leased telephone lines, which are limited to
    data rates of less than 10 000 bits/s. Wideband local networks used for high-speed
    data acquisition and control functions are excluded. This standard covers the
    communication channels, channel interfaces, message format, information field
    usage, and communication management. A standard message protocol is defined to
    the octet level, rather than to the bit level; most details at the bit level are
    left to the manufacturers of SCADA equipment to define and implement.
