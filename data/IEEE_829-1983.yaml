abstract:
- content: A set of basic test documents that are associated with the dynamic aspects
    of software testing (that is, the execution of procedures and code) is described.
    The purpose, outline, and content of each basic document are defined. Although
    the documents described in the standard focus on dynamic testing, several of them
    may be applicable to other testing activities. Documentation on electronic media
    as well as paper is covered. The standard does not call for specific testing methodologies,
    approaches, techniques, facilities, or tools, and does not specify the documentation
    of their use. It also does not imply or impose specific methodologies for documentation
    control, configuration management, or quality assurance.
