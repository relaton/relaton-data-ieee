abstract:
- content: This Guide has been prepared to aid in the effective application of relays
    and other devices for the protection of power transformers. It supplements information
    that was previously published in a Committee Report titled Protection of Power
    Transformers, 1962 Relays Committee Survey of Practices. (Reference 2.1.2) This
    Guide reviews the general philosophy and economic considerations involved in transformer
    protection, describes the types of faults that have been experienced, and discusses
    technical problems with such protection, including current transformer behavior
    under fault conditions. The various types of electric, mechanical, and thermal
    protective devices are described. Associated problems such as fault clearing and
    re-energizing considerations are also discussed. Emphasis in the Guide is placed
    on practical applications rather than basic theory which may be obtained from
    several good references in the Bibliography.
