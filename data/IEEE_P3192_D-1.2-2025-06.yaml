abstract:
- content: This guide describes methods of corrosion inspection and evaluation of
    high-voltage direct current (HVDC) grounding electrodes, including general requirements,
    selection of excavation point, excavation, sampling, corrosion inspection, and
    evaluation. This guide is applicable to corrosion inspection and evaluation of
    HVDC a grounding electrode after excavation with voltage ratings from ±400 kV
    to ±1100 kV.
