abstract:
- content: The significance of oil-spillage regulations and their applicability to
    electric supply substations are discussed; the sources of oil spills are identified;
    typical designs and methods for dealing with oil containment and control of oil
    spills are discussed; and guidelines for preparation of a typical Spill Prevention
    Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan are provided. This guide excludes polychlorinated
    biphenyl (PCB) handling and disposal considerations.
