abstract:
- content: Protocols, procedures, and managed objects for a Link-local Registration
    Protocol (LRP) to replicate a registration database from one end to the other
    of a point-to-point link and to replicate changes to parts of that database are
    specified in this standard. A facility is provided to purge the replicated database
    if the source becomes unresponsive. LRP is optimized for databases on the order
    of 1 Mbyte.
