abstract:
- content: Superseded by 421.2-1990. This guide includes criteria, definitions, and
    test procedures for evaluating the dynamic performance of excitation control systems
    as applied by electric utilities. Primary purposes are to provide a basis for
    evaluating closed-loop performance of excitation control systems (including both
    the synchronous machine and its excitation system) for both large and small signal
    distutbances; confirming the adequacy of mathematical models of excitation systems
    for use in analytical studies of power systems; specifying methods for performing
    test of excitation control systems and their components; and preparing excitation
    system specifications and additional standards. Portions of this guide will also
    serve as an educational means for people becoming acquainted with excitation control
    systems.
