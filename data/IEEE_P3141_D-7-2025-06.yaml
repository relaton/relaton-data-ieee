abstract:
- content: Communications and interoperability between between creators and users
    of 3D body processing (3DBP) technologies has become increasingly difficult. Proprietary
    communication for describing the human body abound but sharing their data with
    new business partners has become problematic due to the lack of a coherent communications
    standard with respect to human body data. To advance global industry communications,
    this standard seeks to define industry terms, and (using those definitions) to
    promote a common communications language. Central to this endeavor are the terms
    “Human” and “Humanoid” to describe the transformation of human body data to digital
    format. With apparel products and wearables being integral to the human experience,
    it is necessary to also include the terms “Cover” and “Coveroid” to describe adornments,
    or enhancement that may be pertinent to a particular 3DBP situation. Methods used
    to create, consume, and transform these “four 3DBP assets” are the focus of this
    standard. The related concepts of Fidelity and Quality are also described. Industry
    players that implement this standard is able to realize the global interoperability
    needed to lower manufacturing costs, to provide more flexibility, features, and
    performance to the consumer, and to 19 improve the level of waste in this industry.
    This standard describes the differences between a digital (virtual) twin and digital
    (virtual) clone and the impact of those differences for use cases. Advancing developments
    in consumer-based industries requires interoperability at a level of detail that
    goes beyond today’s typical peer-to-peer communications that take place between
    individual companies. This standard describes the communication protocols and
    best practices used to support interoperability on a more global level between
    industry participants. The industry use cases range from CGI to phone apps and
    as such the different use cases are presented.
