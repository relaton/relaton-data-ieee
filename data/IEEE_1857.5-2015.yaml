abstract:
- content: A set of tools to support specific audio coding functions including ACELP/TVC
    compression, bandwidth extension, stereo coding, frame erasure concealment, etc.
    is defined in this standard. The tool set defined in this standard provides high
    quality and efficient coding tool sets for compression, decompression, processing,
    and representation of speech, music or mixed audio signals to save transmission
    bandwidth and storage space.
