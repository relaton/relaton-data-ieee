abstract:
- content: The world is witnessing a rapid advance in stereoscopic 3D (S3D), and ultra-high-definition
    (UHD) technology. As a result, the need for accurate quality and visual-comfort
    assessment techniques to foster the display device industry as well as signal-processing
    area. In this standard, thorough assessments with respect to the human visual
    system (HVS) for S3D and UHD contents shall be presented. Moreover, several image
    and video databases are also publicly provided for any research purpose.
