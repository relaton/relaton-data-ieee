abstract:
- content: The scope of the project is to cover measurements of the electrical properties
    of naturally occurring solids. Not covered are methods which rely on mapping earth
    structure anomalies unless directly related to electrical properties. Limited
    coverage of numerical methods for forward/inverse modeling.
