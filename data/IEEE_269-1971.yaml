abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to describe a practical method for measuring
    the transmission characteristics of a telephone set by means of objective measurements
    in a test connection. The test results thus obtained may be used as a means of
    evaluating or specifying the transmission performance of a telephone on a standardized
    basis. The basic accuracy and reproducibility of measurements made in accordance
    with this standard will depend primarily upon the accuracy of the test equipment
    used, the care with which the measurements are conducted, and the inherent stability
    of the telephone and/or transducers under test. Where a given set of measurements
    is repeated in the same laboratory and by the same operator, a relatively high
    degree of reproducibility should normally be obtained. However, when comparing
    measurements made by different laboratories, allowances must be made for the influencing
    factors mentioned above.
