abstract:
- content: This recommended practice defines a file format suitable for exchanging
    power quality related measurement and simulation data in a vendor independent
    manner. The format is designed to represent all power quality phenomena identified
    in IEEE Std 1159 TM -1995, IEEE Recommended Practice on Monitoring Electric Power
    Quality, other power related measurement data, and is extensible to other data
    types as well. The recommended file format utilizes a highly compressed storage
    scheme to minimize disk space and transmission times. The utilization of globally
    unique identifiers (GUID) to represent each element in the file permits the format
    to be extensible without the need for a central registration authority.
