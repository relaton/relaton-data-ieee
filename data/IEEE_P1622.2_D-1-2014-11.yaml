abstract:
- content: 'This standard specifies two data interchange formats for reporting and
    containing election results data exported from voting systems used for managing
    elections and tabulating election results. It allows for reporting on information
    known in advance about the election, for reporting election night results, and
    for reporting on updates and certified results from the post-election canvass.
    It can be used for reporting election results from distributed voting places to
    central offices of the county or state, and from county or state offices to news
    media and the general public. The electronic formats can also be used as a basic
    export of election information from an election management system (EMS) and for
    combining election data from different EMSs or transferring election data between
    EMSs. This standard includes a data model in UML (Unified Modeling Language) that
    itemizes and defines the data involved in election management and election results
    reporting, and specifies two concrete data formats that can be used to import
    and export data from voting systems: --XML (extensible markup language), and--JSON
    (JavaScript Object Notation).'
