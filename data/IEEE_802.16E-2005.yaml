abstract:
- content: This document provides enhancements to IEEE Std 802.16-2004 to support
    subscriber stations moving at vehicular speeds and thereby specifies a system
    for combined fixed and mobile broadband wireless access. Functions to support
    higher layer handoff between base stations or sectors are specified. Operation
    is limited to licensed bands suitable for fixed/mobile use below 6 GHz. Fixed
    802.16-2004 subscriber capabilities shall not be compromised. In addition to mobility
    enhancements, this document contains substantive corrections to IEEE 802.16-2004
    regarding fixed operation.
