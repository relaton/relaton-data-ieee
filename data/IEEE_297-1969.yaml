abstract:
- content: The increasing variety of speech transmission systems has created a new
    problem for communication engineers. This problem consists of the subjective evaluation
    of the speech quality produced by these systems. For investigators interested
    only in the utilization of some procedure applicable to this problem, it, was
    difficult to make a choice among the wide range of documented approaches.
