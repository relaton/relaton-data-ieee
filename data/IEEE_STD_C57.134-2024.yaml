abstract:
- content: Methodologies for determination of the steady-state winding, hottest-spot
    temperature in dry-type distribution and power transformers are described in this
    guide. This guide applies to all dry-type transformers, including those with ventilated,
    sealed, solid cast, and encapsulated windings except transformers described as
    exceptions in IEEE Std C57.12.01.
