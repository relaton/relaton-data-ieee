abstract:
- content: Replaced by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011. The format and contents of a concept
    of operations (ConOps) document are described. AConOps is a user-oriented document
    that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from theusersO viewpoint.
    The ConOps document is used to communicate overall quantitative and qualitativesystem
    characteristics to the user, buyer, developer, and other organizational elements
    (for example,training, facilities, staffing, and maintenance). It is used to describe
