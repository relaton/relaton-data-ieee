abstract:
- content: 'Control mechanisms and management methods necessary to enable creation
    and operation of virtual links in Ethernet-based subscriber access networks are
    described. The key characteristics of the Virtual Link Control (VLC) mechanisms
    are: - The ability to transit Layer 2 bridges in a single IEEE 802 Media Access
    Control (MAC) domain to allow remote device management - Extensibility to accommodate
    new protocols and new types of devices - The ability to simultaneously send messages
    to multiple VLC-aware stations using broadcast or multicast addressing The message
    format, as well as processing operations at the stations participating in the
    VLC protocol, are described.'
