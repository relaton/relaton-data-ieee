abstract:
- content: This International Standard IEC/IEEE 62704-3 describes the concepts, techniques,
    phone models, validation procedures, uncertainties and limitations of the finite
    difference time domain (FDTD) technique when used for determining the peak spatial-average
    specific absorption rate (SAR) in standardized human anatomical models exposed
    to the electromagnetic fields generated by the personal wireless communication
    devices, in particular handheld mobile phones, in the frequency range from 30
    MHz to 6 GHz. It recommends and provides guidance on the numerical modeling of
    mobile wireless communication devices and benchmark data to verify the numerical
    simulations of such devices. It defines acceptable modeling requirements, guidance
    on meshing and test positions of the anatomical models. This document will not
    recommend specific SAR limits since these are found in other documents, e.g.,
    IEEE C95.1-2005 and ICNIRP.
