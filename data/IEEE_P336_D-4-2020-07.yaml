abstract:
- content: Considerations for the pre-installation, installation, inspection, and
    testing of Class 1E power, instrumentation, and control equipment and systems
    of a nuclear facility while in the process of installing, inspecting, and testing
    during new construction, modification, or maintenance are provided. This recommended
    practice does not apply to periodic surveillance testing. For purposes of this
    standard, in addition to a nuclear power plant, a nuclear facility is defined
    as a facility related to the nuclear fuel cycle from fuel processing to reprocessing
    and waste management.
