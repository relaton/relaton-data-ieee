abstract:
- content: The IEEE P287 series of documents presents the combined efforts of IEEE
    P287 Working Group that reflect the knowledge and experience of leading specialists
    in the development and measurement of precision coaxial connectors for RF, microwave
    and millimeter-wave frequencies. It presents minimum performance requirements
    to standardize both hermaphroditic and pin-and-socket-type connectors (IEEE P287.1).
    It provides a recommended practice for electrical and mechanical test procedures
    for Instrument Grade and Metrology Grade precision connectors (IEEE P287.2 this
    document). Recommended reference procedures including connector effects, connector
    care and cleaning, connector repeatability and reproducibility test procedures,
    and a color code for connectors are detailed in the third part of the standard
    (IEEE P287.3). A bibliography provides a list of pertinent references for measurement
    techniques used in determining electrical, mechanical, and dimensional parameters
    for coaxial connectors.
