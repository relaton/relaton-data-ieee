abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 671-1985 provides specifications and test requirements for a non-gyroscopic
    inertial angular sensor that may measure angular jerk, acceleration, rate, or
    displacement with or without response down to zero frequency. A standard specification
    format is provided. A compilation of recommended test procedures, derived from
    those presently used in the industry, is also provided. Informative annexes cover
    design features and theoretical principles of operation. This corrigendum makes
    changes to 4.7.2.6 to delete a sentence that does not belong there, to add a subclause
    that was inadvertently left out, and to renumber the existing subclauses. Changes
    are also being made to fix the block diagrams in Annex A, to correct a misspelling
    of inertia, and to add a missing symbol.
