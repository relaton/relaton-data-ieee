abstract:
- content: A major goal of this standard is to improve communication of bioinformatics
    protocols and data in order to facilitate bioinformatics workflow related exchange
    and communication between regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, bioinformatics
    platform providers and researchers. A detailed communication helps ensure responsibility,
    reproducibility, verify bioinformatics protocol, track provenance information
    and promote interoperability. In addition, this standard also defines the assurance
    program for evaluating and certifying products against those requirements.
