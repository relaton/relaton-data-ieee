abstract:
- content: This standard provides a framework to build and operate SDN/NFV delivery
    infrastructures that satisfies performance expectations of network operators,
    service/content providers, and end users. In particular, the standard specifies
    performance framework including characteristics, metrics, requirements, models
    and use-cases for Software-Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization.
