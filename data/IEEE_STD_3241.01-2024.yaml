abstract:
- content: The zone is the core unit of industrial development and is an important
    component in both promoting urban development and achieving energy conservation
    and emission reduction. The evaluation model and evaluation indicators system
    for low-carbon zones based on blockchain technology are defined in this standard.
    The technical and management requirements are also defined. The purpose is to
    support and promote the construction of a credible regulatory environment and
    carbon emission reduction ecosystem.
