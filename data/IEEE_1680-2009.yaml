abstract:
- content: Guidance and implementation procedures for the IEEE 1680 family of standards
    is provided, and the methods by which manufacturers may declare electronic products
    as conforming with the standards in the IEEE 1680 family of standards and by which
    such conformance may be verified are defined. The standards within the family
    will provide clear and consistent performance criteria for the design of electronic
    products, thereby providing an opportunity to secure market recognition for efforts
    to reduce the environmental impact of electronic products. This family of standards
    is intended to provide a tool for government, institutional, and corporate purchasers.
    Product manufacturers may also use this tool to earn recognition in the consumer
    market, recognizing that certain criteria may not be applicable to all types of
    purchasers.
