abstract:
- content: Rules for the near real-time calculation of pollutant emissions allocated
    to the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure (servers,
    network, etc.) are specified in this standard. Emissions in this standard are
    defined as gaseous and particle emissions caused by the generation of electricity
    consumed during the ICT infrastructure use phase.
