abstract:
- content: Formats for interchanging integer, bit-field, and floating point data between
    heterogeneous multiprocessors in a Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) system are
    specified. The defined data formats can also be used to share data among multiprocessors
    on other bus standards that support the read, write, and lock transaction set
    defined by IEEE Std 1212-1991 CSR Architecture. The intent is to support efficient
    data transfers among heterogeneous workstations within a distributed computing
    environment. (No longer endorsed by the IEEE)
