abstract:
- content: A suggested outline for information that should be included in a design
    criteria for overhead transmission lines is presented in this guide. This guide
    is not a design criteria or a design manual, it is a listing of the information
    that is required during the design of a transmission line, and provides guidance
    for line designers in the collection and documentation of how the line was designed;
    including the sources of information used in design and the design approach used.
