abstract:
- content: This standard is a guideline for establishing criteria for Application
    performance, interchangeability, Tests, Life cycle costs and safety requirements
    of traction power recitifier transformers, Electrical, mechanical and thermal
    design, manufacturing, and testing requirements are set forth for traction power
    rectifier transformers for DC electrification systems. This standard covers Liquid-immersed
    and Dry-type transformers, including those with Cast coil and Epoxy resin Encapsulated
    Windings.
