abstract:
- content: Service conditions, electrical ratings, thermal ratings, electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMC), and environmental testing requirements are defined in this
    standard based upon IEEE standards and five International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC) EMC standards (for which there are no equivalent IEEE standards), to represent
    the harsh environment of electric power apparatus installations. This develops
    a common and reproducible basis for designing and testing devices with communications
    functions installed in this harsh environment. Devices that support communications
    functions use communications ports.
