abstract:
- content: This amendment enhances the UWB PHYs with additional coding options and
    improvements to increase the integrity and accuracy of ranging measurements. It
    also enhances the MAC to support control of time-of-flight ranging procedures
    and exchange ranging related information between the participating ranging devices.
