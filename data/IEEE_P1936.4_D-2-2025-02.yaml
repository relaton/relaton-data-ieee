abstract:
- content: Multi-rotor unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are widely used in the field
    of power inspection. Long-term high-voltage electromagnetic field environments
    and complex climatic conditions, are faced by highly integrated and precise power
    inspection drones. Devices in the multi-rotor UAS may malfunction during the operation
    if not properly maintained. Proper maintenance of the multi-rotor UAS can help
    ensure the long-term safe and stable operation of power inspection drones. At
    present, there is no unified specification for maintenance personnel and no technical
    requirements for troubleshooting and fault diagnosis of multi-rotor UAS software
    and hardware. In this context, the formulation of this standard helps to standardize
    the maintenance procedures of multi-rotor UAS to support the reliability and safety
    of multi-rotor UAS operation.
