abstract:
- content: This standard is to improve the user experience of mobile gaming by solving
    the issues between the high demands from game applications and the resource limitation
    of a mobile device. Message exchange is critical to coordinate the resource allocation
    and to optimize the performance of gaming that ensure fluent user experiences
    in games. Additionally, this standard specifies evaluation methods and criteria
    that enables the control and optimization.
