abstract:
- content: The data format to be used for both required and optional data to be made
    available by radiation measurement instruments for homeland security applications
    is specified. The performance for these types of instruments is described in other
    standards, such as ANSI N42.32, ANSI N42.33, ANSI N42.34, ANSI N42.35, ANSI N42.38,
    ANSI N42.43, ANSI N42.48, ANSI N42.49A, and ANSI N42.53.
