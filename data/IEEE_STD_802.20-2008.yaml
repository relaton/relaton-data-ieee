abstract:
- content: These technical requirements of this standard form a compatibility standard
    for mobile broadband wireless access systems. The requirements standard ensures
    that a compliant Access Terminal (AT) or User Terminal (UT) can obtain service
    through any Access Network Node (AN) or Base Station (BS) conforming to properly
    selected modes of this standard, consistent with equipment and operator requirements,
    thus providing a framework for the rapid development of cost-effective, interoperable
    multivendor mobile broadband wireless access systems. This compatibility standard
    is targeted for use in a wide variety of licensed frequency bands and regulatory
    environments. This specification standard includes provisions provides for future
    service additions and expansion of system standardized extension capabilities.
    The architecture defined by this specification standard permits such expansion
    without the loss of backward compatibility to older access terminals or user terminals.
