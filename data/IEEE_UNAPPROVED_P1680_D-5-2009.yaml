abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1680-2008 provides guidance and implementation procedures for
    IEEE 1680 family of standards and defines the methods by which manufacturers may
    declare electronic products as conforming with the standards in the 1680 family
    of standards and by which such conformance may be verified. The standards within
    the family will provide clear and consistent performance criteria for the design
    of electronic products thereby providing an opportunity tosecure market recognition
    for efforts to reduce the environmental impact of electronic products. This family
    of standards is intended to provide a tool for government, institutional and corporate
    purchasers. Product manufacturers may also use this tool to earn recognition in
    the consumer market, recognizing that certain criteria may not be applicable to
    all types of purchasers.
