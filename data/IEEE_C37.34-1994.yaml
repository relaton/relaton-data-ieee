abstract:
- content: Design test requirements for all high-voltage enclosed indoor and outdoor
    and non-enclosed indoor and outdoor air switches rated above 1000 V are specified.
    This includes requirements for such switches as disconnecting, selector, horn-gap,
    grounding, interrupter, etc., for manual and power operation, except for distribution-enclosed
    single-pole air switches and distribution cutouts fitted with disconnecting blades.(Superseded
