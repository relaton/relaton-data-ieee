abstract:
- content: A simplified method of calculating the current-temperature relationship
    of bare overhead lines, given the weather conditions, is presented. Along with
    a mathematical method, sources of the values to be used in the calculation are
    indicated. This standard does not undertake to list actual temperature-ampacity
    relationships for a large number of conductors in a large number of conditions.
