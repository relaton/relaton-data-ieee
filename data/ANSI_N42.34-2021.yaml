abstract:
- content: Performance specifications and testing methods for the evaluation of handheld
    instruments (also known as radionuclide identification devices or RIDs) used for
    the detection and identification of radionuclides, which emit gamma rays and,
    in some cases, neutrons, are contained in this standard. The specifications for
    general, radiological, environmental, electromagnetic, and mechanical performances
    are given and the corresponding testing methods are described. The documentation
    to be provided by the manufacturer is listed as part of the requirements. Informative
    annexes that provide guidance for the implementation of this standard are also
    included.
