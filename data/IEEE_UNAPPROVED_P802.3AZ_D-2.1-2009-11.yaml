abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2008 specifies changes to several existing
    physical layers to enable energy efficient operation of Ethernet. Changes to 10BASE-T
    include a reduction in transmit voltage requirements. Changes to 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T,
    10GBASE-T, 1000BASE-KX, 10GBASE-KX4 and 10GBASE-KR include the definition of a
    Low Power Idle (LPI) mode and mechanisms to communicate and manage the entry and
    exit into and out of LPI and the operation of this mode. New LLDP TLVs are defined
    for negotiating system level energy efficiency parameters.
