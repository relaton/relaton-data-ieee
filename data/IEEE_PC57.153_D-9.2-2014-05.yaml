abstract:
- content: 'This paralleling guide describes and compares control methods of paralleling
    power transformers equipped with load tap changers (LTC) or series regulators.
    The control methods include: master/follower, circulating current, power factor,
    circulating reactive current, and negative reactance methods. This guide presents
    operating philosophy descriptions, sample wiring diagrams, typical operational
    variations, and typical misapplication consequences. This guide describes field
    commissioning activities, troubleshooting procedures and the provision of adequate
    backup protection.'
