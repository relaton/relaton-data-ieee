abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides unique identification principles and
    definitions that, when used with related recommended practices concerning component
    function identifiers, implementation instructions, and system descriptions, provides
    a basis for uniquely identifying systems, structures, and components of nuclear
    and fossil-fueled power plant projects (electric power generating stations) and
    related facilities. Hydro and other types of power plant projects are not included.
    The standard is part of a series of recommended practices, entitled the Energy
    Industry Identification System (EIIS), the purpose of which is to present a common
    language that will permit a user to correlate a system, structure, or component
    with that of another organization for the purposes of reporting, comparison, or
    general communication. A significant feature of the concept is that the unique
    identification code identifies the function at the component level and not the
    hardware itself.
