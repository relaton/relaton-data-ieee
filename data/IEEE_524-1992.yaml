abstract:
- content: General recommendations for the selection of methods, equipment, and tools
    that have been found to be practical for the stringing of overhead transmission
    line conductors and overhead groundwires are provided. The aim is to present in
    one document sufficient details of present day methods, materials, and equipment
    to outline the basic considerations necessary to maintain safe and adequate control
    of conductors during stringing operations.
