abstract:
- content: The essential performance parameters and general placement for monitoring
    the release of radionuclides associated with a postulated serious accident at
    a reactor facility are defined for various types of instrumentation. The predominant
    consideration in the assessment of radiation emergencies is the measurement of
    fission products made promptly enough to permit timely emergency decisions. This
    standard does not specify which of the instruments or systems are required, nor
    does it consider the number or specific locations of such instruments. This standard
    also does not address single failure criteria associated with nuclear safety instrumentation.
