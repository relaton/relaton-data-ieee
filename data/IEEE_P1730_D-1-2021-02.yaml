abstract:
- content: The recommended practice for Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution
    Process (DSEEP) is described in this document. The DSEEP is intended as a high-level
    process framework into which the lower-level systems engineering practices native
    to any distributed simulation user can be easily integrated. Simulation architectures
    include Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), High Level Architecture (HLA),
    and Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).
