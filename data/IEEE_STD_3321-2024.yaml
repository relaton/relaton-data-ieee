abstract:
- content: Guidelines for applying the assumptions defined in IEEE 2846™-2022 in safety-related
    models during the development, testing, and deployment of automated driving systems
    (ADS) are provided in this recommended practice. Approaches to identify values
    for the applicable IEEE 2846-2022 assumptions given the scenario context; approaches
    for identifying reasonably foreseeable values for these assumptions given the
    scenario context and for updating these assumptions across the temporal evolution
    of a scenario; and approaches to validate the selection of assumptions through
    an analysis of the output of the safety-related model, considering different kinds
    of performance objectives of interest, are specifically covered.
