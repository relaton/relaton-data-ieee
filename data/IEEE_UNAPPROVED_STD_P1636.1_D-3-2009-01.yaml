abstract:
- content: This standard is intended to promote and facilitate interoperability between
    components of an automatic test system (e.g., between test executive and diagnostic
    reasoner) where test results need to be shared. The standard thus facilitates
    the capture of test results data in storage devices and databases, facilitating
    online and offline analysis. The test results schema becomes a class of information
    that can be used within the SIMICA family of standards.
