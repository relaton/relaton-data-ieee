abstract:
- content: This document establishes a Standard Profile for communications with Distributed
    Energy Resources (DER) using IEEE Std 1815, IEEE Standard for Electric Power Systems
    Communications - Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3). This profile consists of
    a high-level data model for DER communications, based on selected data objects
    from International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61850-7-420:2021 mapped to
    a fixed list of DNP3 data points. It also specifies the data objects needed for
    many DER and Inverter-Base Resources (IBR) functions, including those in IEEE
    Std 1547-2018, IEEE Std 2800-2022, and IEEE Std 1547.9-2022, as well as additional
    functions needed for storage systems. In addition, it specifies a mapping to detailed
    equipment-related data objects, primarily for logging and historical purposes.
    The profile is provided in both a written and an electronic format (Profile Companion
    Data Point Tables) for ease of implementation.
