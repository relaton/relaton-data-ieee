abstract:
- content: 'Firmware is the read-only-memory (ROM)-based software that controls a
    computer be tween the time it is turned on and the time the primary operating
    system takes control of the machine. Open Firmware provides the following: a mechanism
    for loading and executing programs (such as operating systems) from disks, tapes,
    network interfaces, and other devices; an ISA independent method for identifying
    devices "plugged in" to expansion buses and for providing firmware and diagnostics
    drivers for these devices; an extensible and programmable command language based
    on the Forth programming language; methods for managing user-configurable options
    stored in nonvolatile memory; a "call back" interface allowing other programs
    to make use of Open Firmware services; and debugging tools for hardware, firmware,
    firmware drivers, and system software.'
