abstract:
- content: The protection of power cables used in industrial and commercial power
    systems is covered in this recommended practice. It is likely to be of greatest
    value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience in the area of protection
    and control. It can also be an aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical
    design of industrial and commercial power systems.
