abstract:
- content: This standard covers certain mechanical requirements for liquid-immersed
    distribution transformers in respect to tank strength as well as static and dynamic
    tank pressure mitigation. This standard can be applied to various tank configurations
    for distribution transformers. This standard does not cover the electrical and
    mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the
    transformer. It is intended to define the mechanical performance requirements
    to prevent permanent tank distortion or rupture of distribution transformers covered
    under this standard. These requirements will provide a more standard design of
    transformer tank and associated components related with both static and dynamic
    pressure coordination.
