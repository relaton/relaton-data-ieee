abstract:
- content: Tests for measuring the pulse-height, spurious-pulse, and pulse-timing
    characteristics of photomultipliers used in scintillation and Cerenkov counters
    are presented. Five different measurement techniques are described. They are rise-time
    measurements, fall-time measurements, photocathode transit-time difference measurements,
    and transit-time spread measurements.
