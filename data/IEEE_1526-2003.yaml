abstract:
- content: This recommended practice presents tests to determine the performance of
    stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems and for verifying PV system design. These
    tests apply only to complete systems with a defined load. Performance testing
    is conducted outdoors under prevailing conditions over a period of about one month.
    These tests are intended to assist designers, manufacturers, system integrators,
    system users, and laboratories that will conduct the tests. System safety and
    component reliability issues are not addressed in this recommended practice.
