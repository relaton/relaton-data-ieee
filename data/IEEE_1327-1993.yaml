abstract:
- content: 'A C programming language binding for the general-purpose OSI Abstract
    Data Manipulation (OM) Application Program Interface (API) in IEEE Std 1224- 1993
    is defined. This standard is intended for use by application developers, system
    implementors, test method writers, and users to support application portability
    at the source-code level. The API defined in this standard contains two major
    parts: an interface for accessing the services defined in the programming language
    independent specification, and an interface for language-specific services.'
