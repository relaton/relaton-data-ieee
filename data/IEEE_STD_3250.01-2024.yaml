abstract:
- content: The contents of this standard defines a trusted data circulation platform
    based on blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. The system overview of
    trusted data circulation platform is defined including underlying computation
    engine layer, blockchain and DLT core function layer, trusted data circulation
    layer, and interface layer. The functional modules, data circulation processes,
    technical and security requirements are specified. This standard includes recommendations
    for controlling the allowable purposes and amount of data utilization, and for
    data privacy and resistance to tampering during the relevant data operations.
