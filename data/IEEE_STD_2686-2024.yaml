abstract:
- content: Information and recommendations on the design, configuration, and interoperability
    of battery management systems in stationary applications is included in this recommended
    practice. The battery management system is considered to be a functionally distinct
    component of a battery energy storage system that includes active functions necessary
    to protect the battery from modes of operation that could impact its safety or
    longevity. Recommendations on how to configure a battery management system to
    protect a given battery type in each application environment are provided. Lastly,
    recommended communication structures and data models that help support interoperability
    and cybersecurity are stipulated. A comprehensive list of best practices around
    the design and integration of battery management systems that protect the safety
    and longevity of batteries in energy storage applications is developed as a result.
