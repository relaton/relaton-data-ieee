abstract:
- content: This standard specifies interchange and arithmetic formats and methods
    for binary and decimal floating-point arithmetic in computer programming environments.
    Exception conditions are defined and default handling of these conditions is specified.
    It is intended that an implementation of a floating-point system conforming to
    this standard can be realized entirely in software, entirely in hardware, or in
    any combination of software and hardware. For operations specified in the normative
    part of this standard, numerical results and exceptions are uniquely determined
    by the values of the input data, sequence of operations, and destination formats,
    all under user control.
