abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 contains provisions for the processes and products
    related to the engineering of requirements for systems and software products and
    services throughout the life cycle. It defines the construct of a good requirement,
    provides attributes and characteristics of requirements, and discusses the iterative
    and recursive application of requirements processes throughout the life cycle.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 provides additional guidance in the application of requirements
    engineering and management processes for requirements-related activities in ISO/IEC
    12207 and ISO/IEC 15288. Information items applicable to the engineering of requirements
    and their content are defined. The content of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 can be added
    to the existing set of requirements-related life cycle processes defined by ISO/IEC
    12207 or ISO/IEC 15288, or can be used independently.
