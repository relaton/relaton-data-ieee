abstract:
- content: 'Control methods of paralleling regulating transformers are described and
    compared in this guide. The control methods include: master/follower, circulating
    current, power factor,circulating reactive current and negative reactance methods.
    Operating philosophy descriptions, sample wiring diagrams, typical operational
    variations, the provision of adequate backup protection, and typical misapplication
    consequences are presented. This guide does not apply to phase-shifting regulating
    transformers.'
