abstract:
- content: This guide addresses the application, design concepts, and implementation
    of computer-based control systems for hydroelectric plant automation. It addresses
    functional capabilities, performance requirements, interface requirements, hardware
    considerations, and operator training. It includes recommendations for system
    testing and acceptance. The electrical protective system (generator and step-up
    transformer) is beyond the scope of this guide.
