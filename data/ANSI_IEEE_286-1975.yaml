abstract:
- content: The purpose of this recommended practice is to describe the power-factor
    tip-up of coil insulation and to establish preferred procedures for its measurement.
    This recommended practice applies to stator coils of rotating machinery operating
    at 6600 V or higher. the coil Insulation under consideration is principally the
    major ground-wall insulation which is external to the conductor structure. Only
    that part of the strand and turn insulation which dielectrically in series with
    the ground-wall insulation enters into the measurements.
