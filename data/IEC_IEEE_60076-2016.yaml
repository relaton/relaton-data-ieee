abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 60076 applies to dry-type and liquid-immersed transformers
    for wind turbine step-up applications having a winding with highest voltage for
    equipment up to and including 72,5 kV. This document applies to the transformer
    used to connect the wind turbine generator to the wind farm power collection system
    or adjacent distribution network and not the transformer used to connect several
    wind turbines to a distribution or transmission network. Transformers covered
    by this document comply with the relevant requirements prescribed in the IEC 60076
    standards or IEEE C57 standards
