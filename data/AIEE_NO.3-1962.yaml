abstract:
- content: This pamphlet serves as a guide in the preparation or revision of standards
    for testing or performance of apparatus or materials of specific types or fields
    of use. If a particular existing standard calls for other provisions, the existing
    standard should be followed. The values given are not mandatory, but are recommended
    for use in preference to other values unless there are good technical or economic
    reasons for using others. The values recommended have in general been selected
    to agree with well established practices particularly in the power and industry
    fields. Provisions are made for a great variety of conditions and for widely different
    apparatus and materials, some of which may be of practical importance only under
    unusual circumstances. In an individual standard, only those quantities of real
    practical importance in the particular case should be used. When ranges are suggested,
    it is generally with the thought that acceptance tests may be made within that
    range. Tests may be made outside the range, if acceptable, and agreed-upon correction
    factors are available.
