abstract:
- content: The standard test procedure for the thermal evaluation and qualification
    of electrical insulation systems (EISs) for random-wound ac electric machinery,
    where thermal degradation is the dominating aging factor, is described. The relative
    thermal performance of a candidate EIS is compared to that of a reference EIS.
    Insulation systems for such machinery with input voltage of up to 600 V at 50/60
    Hz are described in this standard. A statistical method for establishing a relative
    life-temperature relationship for an insulation system is also described. To have
    any significance, the reference insulation system must be supported with adequate
    field service data. Evaluation of insulation systems for use in air-cooled, random-wound
    ac electric machinery with usual service conditions is this procedure s intent.
    This procedure, on its own, does not cover insulation systems such as exposure
    to conducting contaminates, radiation, inverter applications, or operation in
    oils, refrigerants, or other media that potentially degrades insulating materials.
