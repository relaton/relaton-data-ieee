abstract:
- content: The selection and repurposing (including design, operation and maintenance)
    of second-life electric vehicle batteries in energy storage systems with voltage
    levels of 10 kV and below is described in this recommended practice. Various technical
    indexes of batteries and equipment are assessed in different stages of engineering
    to evaluate the system's efficiency, safety, and economic aspects.
