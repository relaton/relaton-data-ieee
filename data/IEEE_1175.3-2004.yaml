abstract:
- content: Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools are used to describe the
    behavior of software using a variety of different design notations. These may
    be graphical or textual in nature, or may be a combination. This standard provides
    a reference model of fundamental software concepts that form the building blocks
    for a number of these commonly used notations. This standard also includes a textual
    language, the Semantic Transfer Language (STL), for representing software application
    behavior descriptions. A software behavior description consists of a collection
    of sentences that conform to the formal syntax of the STL and that are to be interpreted
    in terms of the software concepts defined in this standard. The STL syntax is
    designed to be computer-parsable, while at the same time remaining easy for users
    to read and write. This reference model and transfer syntax may be used for directly
    recording, storing, and analyzing a software behavior description, as well as
    for transferring elements of a software behavior description between CASE tools.
