abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Specifications for the subsystem bus of the IEC 821
    BUS, referred to as the VSB, are set forth. VSB is a local subsystem extension
    bus that allows a processor board to access additional memory and I/O over a local
    bus, removing traffic from the global bus and improving the total throughput of
    the system. The objectives are: to improve the performance of multiprocessor systems
    by allowing the design of local subsystems; to specify the electrical characteristics
    required to design boards that will reliably transfer data over the VSB; to specify
    the mechanical requirements to be compatible with VSB systems; to specify protocols
    that precisely define the interaction between the VSB and devices interfaced to
    it; and to provide terminology and definitions that describe VSB protocols.'
