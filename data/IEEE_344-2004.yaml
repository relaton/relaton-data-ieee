abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std 344-1987 Recommended practices are provided for establishing
    procedures that will yield data to demonstrate that the Class 1E equipment can
    meet its performance requirements during and/or following one safe shutdown earthquake
    event preceded by a number of operating basis earthquake events. This recommended
    practice may be used to establish tests, analyses, or experienced based evaluations
    that will yield data to demonstrate Class 1E equipment performance claims or to
    evaluate and verify performance of devices and assemblies as part of an overall
    qualification effort. Common methods currently in use for seismic qualification
    by test are presented. Two approaches to seismic analysis are described, one based
    on dynamic analysis and the other on static coefficient analysis. Two approaches
    to experienced-based seismic evaluation are described, one based on earthquake
    experience and the other based on test experience.
