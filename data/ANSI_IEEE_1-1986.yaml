abstract:
- content: Technical progress since 1969 revision of this standard has resulted in
    general agreement that a number of service stresses or factors, influence the
    life of electrical insulation, in materials tests and in systems used in electric
    equipment. While earlier editions of this standard made note of this fact, no
    guidance was provided to equipment committees who found a need to incorporate
    these additional factors into specific test guides.
