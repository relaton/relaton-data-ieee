abstract:
- content: This recommended practice establishes requirements for a three-conductor
    round-type oil well cable used in supplying three-phase ac electric power to submersible
    pump motors. Cables meeting the requirements of the recommended practice should
    be rated for voltages not exceeding 3 kV and for ambient temperatures not exceeding
    167 F (75 C). Use of cable above rated temperature can cause premature deterioration
    of the insulation. The cable defined herein is not recommended for installation
    below a temperature of 14 F (-10 C). Voltage ratings are nominal phase-to-phase
    ratings.
