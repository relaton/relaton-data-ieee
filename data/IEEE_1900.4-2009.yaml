abstract:
- content: The building blocks comprising (i) network resource managers, (ii) device
    resource managers, and (iii) the information to be exchanged between the building
    blocks, for enabling coordinated network-device distributed decision making that
    will aid in the optimization of radio resource usage, including spectrum access
    control, in heterogeneous wireless access networks are defined. The standard is
    limited to the architectural and functional definitions at a first stage. The
    corresponding protocols definition related to the information exchange will be
    addressed at a later stage.
