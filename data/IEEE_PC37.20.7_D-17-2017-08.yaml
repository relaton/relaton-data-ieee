abstract:
- content: Procedures for testing and evaluating the performance of switchgear for
    internal arcing faults is covered. A method of identifying the capabilities of
    this equipment is given. Service conditions, installation, and application of
    equipment are also discussed. As used in this document, the term switchgear is
    used as a general term covering switching and interrupting devices and their combination
    with associated control, instrumentation, metering, protective and regulating
    devices, assemblies of those devices with associated interconnections, accessories,
    and supporting structures used primarily in conjunction with the generation, transmission,
    distribution, and conversion of electrical power.
