abstract:
- content: Harmonic studies and analysis of industrial and commercial power systems
    are described. The basic concepts involved in such studies are described first.
    This is followed by a discussion of how to determine the need for a harmonic study,
    how to assemble the required data, how to recognize potential problems, and how
    to implement corrective measures.
