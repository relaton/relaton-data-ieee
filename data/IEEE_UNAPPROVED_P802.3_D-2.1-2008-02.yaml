abstract:
- content: 'Ethernet local area network operation is specified for selected speeds
    of operation from 1 Mb/s to 10 Gb/s using a common media access control (MAC)
    specification and management information base (MIB). The Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) MAC protocol specifies shared medium
    (half duplex) operation, as well as full duplex operation. Speed specific Media
    Independent Interfaces (MIIs) allow use of selected Physical Layer devices (PHY)
    for operation over coxial, twisted pair or fiber optic cables. System considerations
    for multisegment shared access networks describe the use of Repeaters which are
    defined for operational speeds up to 1000 Mb/s. Local Area Network (LAN) operation
    is supported at all speeds. Other specified capabilities include: various PHY
    types for access networks, PHYs suitable for metropolitan area network applications,
    and the provision of power over selected twisted pair PHY types.'
