abstract:
- content: This standard defines a data model for describing, referencing, and sharing
    competency definitions and frameworks of competency definitions, in the context
    of online and distributed learning and in employment and work. This standard provides
    a way to formally represent the key characteristics of a competency definition,
    independently of its use in any particular context. It enables interoperability
    among learning systems that deal with competency information by providing a means
    for them to refer to common definitions with common meanings.
