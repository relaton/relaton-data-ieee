abstract:
- content: Maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures that can be used to
    optimize the life and performance of permanently installed, vented lead-acid storage
    batteries used for standby service are provided. Guidance to determine when batteries
    should be replaced is also provided. This recommended practice is applicable to
    standby service stationary applications where a charger maintains the battery
    fully charged and supplies the dc loads.
