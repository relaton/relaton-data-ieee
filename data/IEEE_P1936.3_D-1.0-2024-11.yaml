- content: Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) survey
    technology, has been widely used in the survey and design of overhead transmission
    line projects benefiting from its high precision and efficiency, especially for
    high-voltage overhead transmission lines in complex terrain areas. To standardize
    the operation process of UAS LiDAR survey and meet the requirements of survey
    and design for overhead transmission line projects with a voltage level above
    110kV, this standard specifies the technical requirements for various production
    stages, including the composition of UAS LiDAR systems, flight design and implementation,
    data processing, 3D (three-dimensional) digital surveying and mapping, field investigation
    and survey, and 3D digital design. It is applicable to guide the survey of the
    light and small civilian UAS LiDAR in the survey and design of new and reconstructed
    overhead transmission line projects and as the reference of the construction,
    operation, and maintenance, etc.
