abstract:
- content: All oil-immersed or dry-type, single-phase or three-phase, outdoor or indoor
    shunt reactors rated over 500 kVA are covered. Terminology and general requirements
    are stated, and the basis for rating shunt reactors is set forth. Routine, design,
    and other tests are described, and methods for performing them are given. Losses
    and impedance, temperature rise, dielectric tests, and insulation levels are covered.
    Construction requirements for oil-immersed reactors and construction and installation
    requirements for dry-type reactors are presented. This standard also covers thyristor-controlled
    shunt reactors used in static var compensators.
