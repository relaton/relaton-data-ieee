abstract:
- content: A technique for the quantification of the activity of identified radionuclides,
    using any of a variety of ionization chambers currently available for this purpose,
    is presented. Application of the standard is limited to instruments that incorporate
    well-type ionization chambers as detectors. The method provides measurements that
    are accurate to within plus or minus 10% and reproducible to within plus or minus
    5%. The standard is also intended to ensure continuing performance of the apparatus
    within these specifications.
