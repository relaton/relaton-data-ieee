abstract:
- content: Definitions given herein apply specifically to semiconductor components
    used for rectification or control of electric power, or both. For the purpose
    of this standard, a semiconductor rectifier component is a semiconductor rectifier
    cell, rectifier diode, or rectifier stack. Note that the name of the actual semiconductor
    material (selenium, silicon, etc.) may be substituted in place of the word "semiconductor"
    in the name of the components.Only those definitions likely to be needed by the
    user are included.
