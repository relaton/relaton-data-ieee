abstract:
- content: Failures of underground cables and accessories can result in the release
    of toxic gases and large amounts of energy. These failures include smoking manholes,
    manhole fires and manhole explosions. These failure events can damage underground
    infrastructure and pose a risk to the maintenance crews and the public. The guide
    examines the root causes, prevention, early detection, mitigation and response
    to failures of accessories and cable inside of, and connected to underground electrical
    structures (i.e. manholes, vaults, handholes, etc.). It suggests methods that
    can help prevent manhole events from occurring and identifies methods that can
    mitigate the severity if a manhole event should occur.
