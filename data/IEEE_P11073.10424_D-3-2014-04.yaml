abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of the communication
    between sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment (SABTE) devices (agents) and
    managers (e.g. cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set
    top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages
    appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology,
    information models, application profile standards, and transport standards. It
    specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth
    environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability.
    This standard defines a common core of communication functionality for SABTE.
    In this context, SABTE are defined as devices that are intended to alleviate the
    symptoms of a patient who suffers from sleep apnoea by delivering a therapeutic
    breathing pressure to the patient. SABTE are primarily used in the home healthcare
    environment by a lay operator without direct professional supervision.
