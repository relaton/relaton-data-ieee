abstract:
- content: This standard was developed as a replacement for Section 8. (Test Procedures)
    of American National Standard for Low-Voltage AC Power Circuit Protectors Used
    in Enclosures, C37.29-1974 (IEEE Std 508-1974), for the purpose of providing a
    separate document to facilitate use by independent testing laboratories. Since
    these test procedures are considered new by the laboratories, experience factors
    may require revision and a separate document can be revised quickly and economically.This
    standard is one of several in a series of test procedures standards for certification
    of various switchgear products. They establish the mandatory requirements that
    a product must meet (as certified by an independent testing laboratory) in order
    to satisfy federal law and local electrical codes.
