abstract:
- content: Recommendations for systems engineering, design, and integration of electrical
    power systems at the total ship level from concept design through the establishment
    of the design baseline prior to detailed design are provided in this document.
    Recommendations for ac power systems, dc power systems, emergency power systems,
    shore power, quality of service, power quality and harmonics, electric propulsion
    and maneuvering systems, motors and drives, thrusters, and steering systems onboard
    ships are established by this document. Present-day technologies, engineering
    methods, and engineering practices are reflected by these recommendations. This
    document is intended to be used in conjunction with the IEEE 45™ series of documents.
