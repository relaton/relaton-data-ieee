abstract:
- content: To provide the means to define and describe signals used in testing. The
    standard provides a set of common basic signals, mathematically under pinned so
    that signals can be combined to form complex signals useable across all test platforms.
    The provision of language elements supports test signal descriptions for interoperability.
