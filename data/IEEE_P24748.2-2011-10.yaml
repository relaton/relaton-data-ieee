    this standard. ISO/IEC TR 24748-2:2011 is a guide for the application of ISO/IEC
    15288:2008. It addresses system, life cycle, process, organizational, project,
    and adaptation concepts, principally through reference to ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 and
    ISO/IEC 15288:2008. It then gives guidance on applying ISO/IEC 15288:2008 from
    the aspects of strategy, planning, application in organizations, and application
    on projects. ISO/IEC TR 24748-2:2011 is intentionally aligned with both ISO/IEC
    TR 24748-1 and ISO/IEC TR 24748-3 (Guide to the application of ISO/IEC 12207)
