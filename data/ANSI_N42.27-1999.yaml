abstract:
- content: Minimum informational requirements for a Test and Measurement Report for
    flood sourc-es used with scintillation cameras are provided. It is not intended
    to specify the means by which such information is obtained although it does place
    requirements and limitations on the methodol-ogy. In addition, it is not intended
    to cover the use of the source in the determination of the operating characteristics
    or correction factors for a scintillation camera.
