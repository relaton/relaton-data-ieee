abstract:
- content: Methods used to place cable underground vary widely. The choice of method
    depends on such factors as soil conditions, surface and subsurface obstructions,
    total footage to be installed, spacing between taps or splices, joint trenching
    practices between utilities, depth of burial desired or required, size of cable,
    and tools available. This guide explores the interrelations of these contributing
    factors suggesting what should be considered, determinations to be made, and the
    decisions required before selecting the plowing method for the installation of
    direct buried cable.
