abstract:
- content: A property graph description of high-quality road network data, such as
    lanes, roads, and intersections, is given in this standard. Lanes, roads, and
    intersections within a road network are depicted as nodes, while the connections
    and relationships between these elements are illustrated by edges in the graph.
    This standard also defines properties of graph nodes and edges, as well as data
    types.
