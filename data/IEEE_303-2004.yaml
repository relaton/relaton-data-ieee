abstract:
- content: 'This recommended practice applies to the application and installation
    procedures of auxiliary devices in or on electric rotating machines that are employed
    in hazardous locations classified as Class 1, Division 2 or Class I Zone 2 under
    commonly used worldwide regulations. These regulations are: the National Electrical
    Code (United States); the Canadian Electrical Code, Part 1 (Canada); and combined
    practices of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the European
    Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), and Standards Australia
    / Standards New Zealand (AS/NZS). Included is a list of source documents, definitions
    and nomenclature. Devices include terminal housings, heaters, surge protection,
    power factor correction capacitors, shaft grounding, and enclosures. Special marking
    requirements are also discussed'
