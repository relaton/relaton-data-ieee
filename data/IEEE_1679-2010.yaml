abstract:
- content: Recommended information for an objective evaluation of an emerging energy
    storage device or system by a potential user for any stationary application is
    covered in this document. Energy storage technologies are those that provide a
    means for the reversible storage of electrical energy, i.e., the device receives
    electrical energy and is able to discharge electrical energy at a later time.
    The storage medium may be electrochemical (e.g., batteries), kinetic (e.g., flywheels),
    electrostatic (e.g., electric double-layer capacitors), thermal, or some other
    medium. Devices recharged by non-electrical means, such as fuel cells, are beyond
    the scope of this document. The document provides a common basis for the expression
    of performance characteristics and the treatment of life-testing data. A standard
    approach for analysis of failure modes is also provided, including assessment
    of safety attributes. The intent of this document is to ensure that characterization
    information, including test conditions and limits of applicability, is sufficiently
    complete to allow valid comparisons to be made.
