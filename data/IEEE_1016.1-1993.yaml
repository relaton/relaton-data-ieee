abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Mar 06, 2000. No longer endorsed by
    the IEEE. The application of design methods and design documentation recommended
    in IEEE Std 1016-1987 is described. Several common design methods are used to
    illustrate the application of IEEE Std 1016-1987, thus making the concepts of
    that standard more concrete. The information in this guide may be applied to commercial,
    scientific, or military software that runs on any computer. Applicability is not
    restricted by the size, complexity, or criticality of the software.'
