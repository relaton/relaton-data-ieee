abstract:
- content: This guide provides information on the differences between stationary standby
    and stationary cycling applications and appropriate battery management strategies
    in cycling operations. While the primary emphasis is on lead-acid batteries, information
    is also provided on alternative and emerging storage technologies. The management
    of battery systems in stationary standby service is covered in other IEEE documents
    and is beyond the scope of this guide.
