abstract:
- content: This document defines assurance-related terms and establishes an organized
    set of concepts and their relationships, thereby establishing a basis for shared
    understanding of the concepts and principles central to all parts of ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15026 across its user communities. It provides information to users of the subsequent
    parts of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026, including the use of each part and the combined use
    of multiple parts. Coverage of assurance for a service being operated and managed
    on an ongoing basis is not covered in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 series.
