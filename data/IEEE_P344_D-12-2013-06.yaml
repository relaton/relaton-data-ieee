abstract:
- content: Practices are provided for establishing procedures that will yield data
    to demonstrate that the equipment can meet its performance requirements during
    and/or following one safe shutdown earthquake event preceded by a number of operating
    basis earthquake events. This standard may be used to establish tests, analyses,
    or experienced-based evaluations that will yield data to demonstrate equipment
    performance claims or to evaluate and verify performance of devices and assemblies
    as part of an overall qualification effort. Common methods currently in use for
    seismic qualification by test are presented. Two approaches to seismic analysis
    are described, one based on dynamic analysis and the other on static coefficient
    analysis. Two approaches to experienced-based seismic evaluation are described,
    one based on earthquake experience and the other based on test experience.
