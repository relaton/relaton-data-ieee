abstract:
- content: The High Level Architecture (HLA) has been developed to provide a common
    architecture for distributed modeling and simulation. The HLA defines an integrated
    approach that provides a common framework for the interconnection of interacting
    simulations. This document, the third in a family of three related HLA documents,
    defines the format and syntax (but not content) of HLA object models. The standards
    contained in this architecture are interrelated and need to be considered as a
    product set, when changes are made. They each have value independently.
