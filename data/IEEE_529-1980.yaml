abstract:
- content: A specification format guide for the preparation of a rate-integrating
    gyroscope specification is presented. Recommended procedures for testing a rate-integrating
    gyroscope are compiled. This standard, when combined with IEEE Std 517-1974 (R1980),
    defines the requirements and test procedures in terms of characteristics unique
    to the gyroscope or those applications in which the dynamic angular inputs are
    significantly greater than the limitations identified in IEEE Std 517.
