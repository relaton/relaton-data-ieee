abstract:
- content: This guide presents an overview of User Organization Open System Environment
    (OSE) Profiles and their application. It is intended to assist users, planners,
    and implementers in developing User Organization OSE Profiles that address the
    operational requirements of the organization; related information technology services;
    and the standards, standards options, and interim solutions that will meet those
    requirements. The guide also includes conformance testing and transition planning
    considerations as well as examples of user organization OSE profiles.
