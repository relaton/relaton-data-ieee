abstract:
- content: This standard defines a method for exchange of synchronized phasor measurement
    data between power system equipment. It specifies messaging including types, use,
    contents, and data formats for real-time communication between Phasor Measurement
    Units (PMU), Phasor Data Concentrators (PDC), and other applications.
