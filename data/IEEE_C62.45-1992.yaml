abstract:
- content: Superseded by C62.45-2002. Guidance is provided for applying surge testing
    to ac power interfaces of equipment connected to low-voltage ac power circuits
    that are subject to transient overvoltages. Signal and data lines are not addressed
    in this document, nor are any specifications stated on the withstand levels that
    might be assigned to specific equipments. An important objective of the document
    is to call attention to the safety aspects of surge testing.
