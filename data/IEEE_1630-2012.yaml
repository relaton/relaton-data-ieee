abstract:
- content: 'Minimum structural requirements for structural supports used for overhead
    contact systems for heavy rail, light rail, and trolley bus systems, including
    loading, safety factors, and deflection are provided by this standard. This standard
    is developed to govern the design and fabrication of supporting structures for
    OCS. It is provided to define minimum general design and construction parameters
    for the following tubular steel pole types: tapered and constant diameter round,
    tapered and constant diameter multi-sided, sectional and fluted.'
