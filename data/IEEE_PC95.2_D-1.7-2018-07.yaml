abstract:
- content: Symbols to inform people about the presence of potentially hazardous levels
    of radiofrequency energy or the presence of contact current hazards in the frequency
    range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz are specified in this standard. Guidance is given about
    how these symbols should be used on warning signs and labels. (The PDF of this
