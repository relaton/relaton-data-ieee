abstract:
- content: The Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) is defined. Verilog HDL
    is a formal notation intended for use in all phases of the creation of electronic
    systems. Because it is both machine readable and human readable, it supports the
    development, verification, synthesis, and testing of hardware designs; the communication
    of hardware design data; and the maintenance, modification, and procurement of
    hardware. The primary audiences for this standard are the implementors of tools
    supporting the language and advanced users of the language.
