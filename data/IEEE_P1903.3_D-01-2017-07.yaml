abstract:
- content: This standard specifies protocols between Overlay Management (OM) Functional
    Entity (FE) and all other NGSON FEs, and/or NGSON nodes to enable OM FE involved
    self-organizing management capability. This capability includes activation and
    deactivation of an NGSON node and addition, deletion, movement and copy of an
    NGSON function entity from or to an NGSON node. This standard also specifies protocols
    among Service Routing (SR) FEs to enable OM FE non-involved self-organizing management
    capability such as re-organization of overlay structure among multiple SR FEs
    for recovery from a failed or overloaded SR FE or for performance improvement
    of service routing.
