abstract:
- content: A data model to support the interchange of data elements and their values
    between a content object and a runtime service (RTS) is described in this standard.
    This standard is based on a current industry practice called “computer managed
    instruction” (CMI). The work on which this standard is based was developed to
    support a client&#8211;server environment in which a learning technology system,
    generically called a “learning management system” (LMS), delivers digital content,
    called “content objects,” to learners. The data model supports learner data and
    preferences; interactions; objectives; content-object entry, exit, and status
    information; time parameters; and scores.
