abstract:
- content: This white paper gives a brief introduction to conceptual classification
    of high-level functional components of adaptive instructional systems identified
    by the project group, and a proposed model for classifying AISs based on levels
    of adaptivity. It is offered as a frame for current and future standards development,
    baseline concepts to facilitate dialog across AIS standards projects.
