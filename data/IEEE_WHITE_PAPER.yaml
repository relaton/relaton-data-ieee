abstract:
- content: While automated driving system (ADS)-operated vehicles hold the potential
    for safety improvement compared to human drivers, the recognition that transportation
    will continue to entail some level of risk has to be considered. Human drivers
    rely on extensive daily experience in their interactions with other agents on
    the road, which helps them craft assumptions about reasonably foreseeable behavior
    of other road users. Similarly, ADS-operated vehicles will also need to make assumptions.
    Such assumptions play a role within ADS safety-related models, which provide a
    representation of safety-relevant aspects of driving behavior pertaining to both
    ADS-operated vehicles and other road users. Furthermore, formal safety-related
    models provide transparency and certainty in ADS decision-making contexts as they
    can be formally verified. Therefore, this paper introduces how several safety-related
    models are making use of reasonably foreseeable assumptions to help with the decision
    making of an ADS-operated vehicle.
