abstract:
- content: The SustainMobility Impact Assessment Framework provides a structured approach
    to evaluate the impacts of sustainable mobility systems, aligning them with international
    initiatives like the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It
    reviews existing initiatives, IEEE efforts, and introduces a taxonomy categorizing
    strategies, technologies, and interoperable mobility solutions. This white paper
    focuses on related work and a framework for sustainable mobility. Further white
    papers will follow, covering methods and use cases.
