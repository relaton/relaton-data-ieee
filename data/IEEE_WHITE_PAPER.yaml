abstract:
- content: Imagine the future we can build together. This is the vision driving the
    work of Planet Positive 2030, an initiative created and supported by the IEEE
    Standards Association that brings together a global, diverse, open community of
    experts to help chart a path for all people to achieve a flourishing future for
    2030 and beyond. The first step to imagine this future is to recognize the planet
    Earth and all its ecosystems form a part of all of us. The air we breathe, the
    water we drink, and the food earth provides comprise who we are. We cannot continue
    to treat planet Earth as a “resource” from which to be extracted - planet Earth
    is finite with finite resources. We should, instead, prioritize the health of
    our planetary biosphere and recognize that we humans are a part of the system,
    not above it or outside it.
