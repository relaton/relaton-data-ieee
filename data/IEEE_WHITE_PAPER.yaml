abstract:
- content: This white paper, developed by the Functional Safety Standards Committee
    (FSSC), describes the landscape of functional safety terminology as used across
    multiple domains. It has been observed that there are multiple definitions for
    many of the terms--some of which are domain specific--and there is often an assumption
    that the terms are commonly understood. Some of the definitions have key differences,
    which could lead engineers to misunderstanding if they apply a definition that
    is used in one domain to another. This white paper takes an overview of the existing
    landscape and establishes a subset of terminology for use in future standards
    sponsored by the FSSC. It discusses the different understandings of the terminologies
    used and where they differ and defines a single understanding of the terminology
    for future use. If the context of a future standard requires a deviation from
    the definition in this document, then the deviation should be explicitly marked
    and defined and should be flagged to the FSSC for consideration in future revisions
    of this document.
