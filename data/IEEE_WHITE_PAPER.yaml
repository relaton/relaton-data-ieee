abstract:
- content: In response to the education crisis during restrictions of COVID-19 pandemic,
    continuation of education was carried out through broadcasting and digital technologies.
    However, the majority of children around the world are seen to not have access
    to such technology. For those who have access to technology and devices, education
    delivery has not been effective due to lack of digital skills in educators and
    learners. For those with internet access and digital skills, challenges of online
    exploitation, violence, and exposure to harmful content is felt. In such a scenario,
    in order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal SDG 4, adoption of holistic e-resilience
    by design is needed to help ensure that education is inclusive and fit for the
    future. But in order to succeed, all stakeholder involvement from the entire ecosystem
    is essential. This paper has examined critical aspects across the educational
    ecosystem, highlighted gaps in essential components, and posed alternative approaches
    and policy reforms. Multiple dimensions necessary for e-resilient education system
    have been considered while making the recommendations. National policies and multilateral
    collaborative approaches are needed to bridge the digital divide and help ensure
    broadband connectivity for digital education of all students. It is also important
    to overcome any linguistic barrier. Encouraging technologies to develop educational
    contents in local language can ensure that language digital divide is bridged.
    Another important aspect of a resilient education system is putting efforts in
    improving digital skills of educators and learners. Digital literacy programs
    must be implemented effectively in order to achieve a digitally competent population.
    The next pertinent aspect is measurement of learning outcomes of students. Different
    approaches are needed to measure and ensure that meaningful learning is taking
    place in digital space. It is also important to consider that the content of learning
    is relevant to the student and the economy, as well as that the means of delivery
    must also accommodate the learning needs of students. A greater emphasis on digital
    transformation of technical and vocational education and training in alignment
    to the labor market must be given while developing curriculum for education.
