abstract:
- content: This standard is applicable to fire stops of various materials and construction.
    Cable-penetration fire stops are intended for use in fire-resistive barriers.
    Tests conducted in conformance with this standard will record the performance
    of fire stops during the test exposure. The resistance of a fire stop to an external
    force imposed by a hose stream or water spray will also be considered in this
    standard. The intent of this standard is to develop data to assist in determining
    the suitability of a fire stop for use where fire resistance is required.
