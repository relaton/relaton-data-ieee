abstract:
- content: Class 1E portions of ac and dc power systems and instrumentation and control
    power systems in single-unit and multiunit nuclear power generating stations are
    covered. Not included are the preferred power supply; unit generator(s) and their
    buses; generator breaker; step-up, auxiliary, and start-up transformers; connections
    to the station switchyard; switchyard; transmission lines; and the transmission
    network. The intent is to provide criteria for the determination of Class 1E power
    system design features, criteria for sharing Class 1E power systems in multiunit
    stations, and the requirements for their testing and surveillance.
