abstract:
- content: Autonomous systems operate in complex, dynamic environments and make runtime
    decisions that control their behavior, often without human intervention. Ensuring
    the safety, reliability, and performance of such systems requires rigorous verification
    processes that account for these complexities. This Guide for Verification of
    Autonomous Systems enables the user to define a customized process for verification
    of their autonomous system at the component and system levels based on their needs
    and available resources. It documents challenges and best practices for specification
    development, verification across all levels of abstraction, integration with fault
    management and runtime assurance components, and provision of evidence for licensure,
    certification, and assurance.
