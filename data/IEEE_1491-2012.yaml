abstract:
- content: Operational parameters that may be observed by battery monitoring equipment
    used in stationary applications and the relative value of such observations are
    discussed in this guide. Although a list of commercially available systems is
    not given, a means for establishing specifications for the desired parameters
    to be monitored is provided.
