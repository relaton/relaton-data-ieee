abstract:
- content: Two alternate physical layers (PHYs), TASK and RS-GFSK, are specified in
    this amendment in addition to the PHYs of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015. The amendment
    also defines the medium access control (MAC) modifications needed to support the
    implementation of the TASK and RS-GFSK PHYs. These alternate PHYs enable low-cost,
    ultra-low power consumption, as well as extended battery life, in various frequency
    bands and geographical regions under multiple regulatory domains. (The PDF of
    this standard is available at no cost compliments of the IEEE GET program. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7466448/)
