abstract:
- content: The independence requirements of the circuits and equipment comprising
    or associated with Class 1E systems are described in this standard. Criteria for
    the independence that can be achieved by physical separation and electrical isolation
    of circuits and equipment that are redundant are set forth. The determination
    of what is to be considered redundant is not addressed.
