abstract:
- content: As an aid in testing circuit breakers under conditions of switching capacitive
    currents synthetic test circuits may be used. The design of the circuit should
    simulate the stress of actual service conditions as closely as possible. A number
    of circuits are given as examples. The limitation of the use of synthetic test
    methods is that the breaker under test must not display evidence of re-ignition
    or re-striking. The known circuits do not properly represent the interaction between
    the source and the capacitive load under this condition. Such breakers must be
    tested using direct circuits.
