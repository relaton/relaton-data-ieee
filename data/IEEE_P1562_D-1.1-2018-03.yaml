abstract:
- content: Information to assist in sizing the array and battery of a stand-alone
    photovoltaic (PV) system is provided by this guide. Systems considered in this
    guide consist of PV as the only power source and a battery for energy storage.
    These systems also commonly employ controls to protect the battery from being
    over- or undercharged, and may employ a power conversion subsystem (inverter or
    converter). This guide is applicable to all stand-alone PV systems where PV is
    the only charging source. This guide does not include PV hybrid systems nor grid-connected
    systems. This guide covers lead-acid batteries only; nickel-cadmium and other
    battery types are not included. This guide does not include the sizing of the
    system controller, inverter, wiring, or other system components.
