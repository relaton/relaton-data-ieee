abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1708 establishes a normative definition of wearable cuffless blood
    pressure (BP) measuring devices and the objective performance evaluation of this
    kind of device. The standard is independent of the form of the device or the vehicle
    to which the device is attached or in which it is embedded. The standard is applicable
    to all types of wearable BP measurement devices including epidermal and unobtrusive
    BP devices that have different modes of operation (e.g., to measure short-term,
    long-term, snapshot, continuous, beat(s)-to-beat(s) BP, or BP variability). This
    standard is, however, limited to evaluation of devices that do not use a cuff
    during measurement and do not cover evaluation of all sphygmomanometers that are
    used with an occluding or inflatable cuff for the indirect determination of BP
    on the upper arm or wrist. This standard provides guidelines for manufacturers
    to qualify and validate their products, potential purchasers or users to evaluate
    and select prospective products, and health care professionals to understand the
    manufacturing practices on wearable BP devices.
