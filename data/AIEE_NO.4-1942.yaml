abstract:
- content: 'In this Standard are set forth methods for the measurement of test voltages
    and wave shapes used in dielectric tests of electric apparatus or insulating material.
    These tests are in three classes: 1. Puncture tests. 2. Flashover tests.3. Voltage
    proof tests. The tests may involve the use of alternating current, direct current,
    or surges from surge generators. Different pieces of apparatus may require different
    dielectric tests, some requiring power frequency or direct current tests only;
    other apparatus may require surge tests in addition. The specific requirements
    for any particular type of apparatus will be found in the Standard dealing with
    that type of apparatus. This Standard deals with the measurements themselves.'
