abstract:
- content: Line trap inserted into a power line to provide a high impedance at power-line-carrier
    frequencies (30 kHz to 500 kHz) is applied in this standard. The purpose is to
    isolate the carrier signal from system impedance changes due to faults or switching
    behind the point of insertion, and guide the signal in the proper direction. The
    standard covers line traps in which the main coil is designed as a single phase,
    air-cooled inductor of the dry type.
