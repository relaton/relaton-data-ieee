abstract:
- content: This standard provides methods for the measurement of sound pressure level
    produced by outdoor alternating current circuit-breakers in a free-field environment.
    These methods may also be used indoors or in restricted field, provided that precautions
    are observed in the measurement and interpretation of the results.
