abstract:
- content: A practical method for determining the magnetic-field characteristics of
    a telephone receiver by means of objective measurements in a test connection is
    described. The method was developed in response to a need to specify the magnetic
    field at selected locations around a telephone receiver, required for satisfactory
    coupling of hearing aids. However, the method is sufficiently general to allow
    complete mapping of the magnetic field. It is also useful for other applications
    where knowledge of the magnetic field intensity is required.
