abstract:
- content: This guide applies to station service systems that supply electric power
    to auxiliary loads for electric power generating stations. The discussions and
    recommendations contained herein provide the practices, criteria, and range of
    system parameters that relate to the service system requirements and assist in
    the application of existing engineering documents. This guide is not a handbook
    of design data; however, it explains what is good practice for the many different
    types of electric power service systems for generating stations.
