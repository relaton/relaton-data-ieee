abstract:
- content: General guidelines and criteria for the field testing of static var compensators
    (SVCs), before they are placed in-service, for the purpose of verifying their
    specified performance are described. The major elements of a commissioning program
    are identified so that the user can formulate a specific plan that is most suited
    for his or her own SVC.
