abstract:
- content: 'A method of collecting and presenting reliability data for use in nuclear
    power generating station reliability calculations is established. It applies to
    reliability data for electrical, electronic, sensing component, and mechanical
    equipment. The objectives of the calculations are: (1) to determine system adequacy;
    (2) to evaluate system design alternatives; (3) to evaluate, or contribute to,
    the development of system test intervals, maintenance programs, or operating procedures,
    or all three; and (4) to contribute to probabilistic risk-assessment studies.'
