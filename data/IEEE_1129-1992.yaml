abstract:
- content: A basic philosophy and guidelines are established for the design and implementation
    of monitoring systems for cylindrical-rotor, synchronous turbine generators. Monitoring
    systems are used to display the status of the generator and auxiliary systems
    while these systems are operating on line. The basic information needed to choose
    monitoring schemes best suited for each application is provided. This standard
    does not specify actual equipment or instrumentation, but it does indicate some
    critical areas where it is important to provide monitoring capability
