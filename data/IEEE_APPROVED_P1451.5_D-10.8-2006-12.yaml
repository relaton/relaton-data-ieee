abstract:
- content: This standard defines a wireless interface for sensors. It specifies radio-specific
    protocols for this wireless interface. It defines communication modules that connect
    the wireless transducer interface module (WTIM) and the network capable applications
    processor (NCAP) using the radio-specific protocols. It also defines the transducer
    electronic data sheets (TEDS) for the radio-specific protocols.
