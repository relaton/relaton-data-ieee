- content: Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) criteria and consensus test and measurements
    procedures for broadband over power line (BPL) communication equipment and installations
    are presented. Existing national and international standards for BPL equipment
    and installations are referenced. This standard does not include the specific
    emission limits, which are subject to national regulations.
