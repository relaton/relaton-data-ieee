abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies enhancements to the IEEE 802.11 medium access
    control (MAC) that support wireless local area network (WLAN) interworking with
    external networks. It enables higher layer functionalities to provide overall
    end-to-end solutions. The main goals of this amendment are aiding network discovery
    and selection, enabling information transfer from external networks, enabling
    emergency services, and interfacing subscription service provider networks (SSPNs)
    to IEEE 802.11 networks that support interworking with external networks.
