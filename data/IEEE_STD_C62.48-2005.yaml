abstract:
- content: Information is provided to users and manufacturers of surge-protective
    devices (SPDs) about the interactions that can occur between SPDs and power system
    disturbances. This guide applies to SPDs manufactured to be connected to 50 or
    60 Hz ac power circuits rated at 100-1000 V RMS. The effects of the presence and
    operation of SPDs on the quality of power available to the connected loads are
    described. The interaction between multiple SPDs on the same circuit is also described.
