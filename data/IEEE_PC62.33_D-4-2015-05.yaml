abstract:
- content: 'Test methods and preferred values for metal-oxide varistor (MOV) surge
    protective components are covered in this standard and have the following main
    parameter ranges: packaging (leaded disc-type or surface mount), nominal varistor
    voltage (5 V to 1200 V), 8/20 surge current rating (10 A to 70 kA), and 8/20 clamping
    voltage (10 V to 3 kV). With appropriate component selection, these components
    could be used for the overvoltage protection of power and signal systems having
    continuous ac voltages (2.5 V rms to 750 V rms), steady-state dc voltages (3.3
    V to 1000 V), and peak signal feed voltages (3.5 V to 850 V). Information is given
    on manufacturer type testing used to determine environmental performance and rated
    values.'
