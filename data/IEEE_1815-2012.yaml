abstract:
- content: The DNP3 protocol structure, functions, and interoperable application options
    (subset levels) are specified. The simplest application level is intended for
    low-cost distribution feeder devices, and the most complex for full-featured systems.
    The appropriate level is selected to suit the functionality required in each device.
    The protocol is suitable for operation on a variety of communication media consistent
    with the makeup of most electric power communication systems.
