abstract:
- content: 'The following enclosed low-voltage ac power circuit breakers are covered
    in this standard: a) stationary or drawout type of two-, three-, or four-pole
    construction, with one or more rated maximum voltages of 1058 V, 730 V, 635 V
    (600 V for units incorporating fuses), 508 V, or 254 V for application on systems
    having nominal voltages of 1000 V, 690 V, 600 V, 480 V, or 240 V; b) unfused or
    fused circuit breakers; c) manually or power operated; and d) with or without
    electromechanical or electronic trip devices. Service conditions, ratings, functional
    components, temperature limitations and classifications of insulating materials,
    insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, application,
    and the preferred ratings are discussed in this standard.'
