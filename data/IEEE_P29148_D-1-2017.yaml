abstract:
- content: This document contains provisions for the processes and products related
    to the engineering of requirements for systems and software products and services
    throughout the life cycle. It defines the construct of a good requirement, provides
    attributes and characteristics of requirements, and discusses the iterative and
    recursive application of requirements processes throughout the life cycle. This
    document provides additional guidance in the application of requirements engineering
    and management processes for requirements-related activities in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207
    and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288. Information items applicable to the engineering of requirements
    and their content are defined. The content of this document can be added to the
    existing set of requirements-related life cycle processes defined by ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, or can be used independently.
