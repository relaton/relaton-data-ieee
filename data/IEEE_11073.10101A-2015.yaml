abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care
    (POC) medical device communication (MDC), the nomenclature defined by the base
    ISO/IEEE 11073-10101:2004 nomenclature standard is extended by this amendment.
    Significant extensions to support haemodynamics, respiration, ventilation and
    anesthesia monitoring, blood gas, urine, fluid-related metrics, and neurology,
    as well as units of measurements and measurement sites, are included. Formal definitions
    for observation identifiers used by the IEEE 11073 Personal Health Device standards
    and additional attributes for reporting their regulatory and certification status
    are also captured and provided. Information attributes to support alert communication
    and accurate medical device time synchronization and timekeeping are also defined.
