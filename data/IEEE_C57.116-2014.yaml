abstract:
- content: Information on the selection and application considerations for the unit
    power transformer and unit auxiliaries power transformer is provided in this guide.
    Consideration is given to connections that include direct connection and connections
    through generator circuit breakers and load-break switches. The considerations
    referred to in this guide apply to hydroelectric and thermal electric generating
    stations. Various power transformer connections and possibleoperating problems
    under normal and abnormal conditions are treated. Phasing procedures, basic impulse
    insulation level selection, and loading practices are not covered.
