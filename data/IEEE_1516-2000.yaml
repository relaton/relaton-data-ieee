abstract:
- content: The High Level Architecture (HLA)Framework and Rules is the capstone document
    fora family of related HLA standards. It defines the HLA, its components, and
    the rules that outline theresponsibilities of HLA federates and federations to
    ensure a consistent implementation.Simulations are abstractions of the real world,
    and no one simulation can solve all of the functional needs for the modeling and
    simulation community. It is anticipated that technology advances will allow for
    new and different modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) implementations within the
    frameworkof the HLA. The standards contained in this architecture are interrelated
    and need to be considered as a product set, as a change in one is likely to have
    an impact on the others. As such, the HLA isan integrated approach that has been
    developed to provide a common architecture for simulation.
