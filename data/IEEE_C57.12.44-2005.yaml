abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std C57.12.44-2000. The performance, electrical and mechanical
    interchangeability, and the safety of the equipment are covered. The proper selection
    of such equipment is established as a basis for use in this standard. Certain
    electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are described; and certain
    safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz, low-voltage (600 V and below) network protectors
    are taken into consideration. This equipment is used for automatically connecting
    and disconnecting a network transformer from a secondary spot or grid network.
