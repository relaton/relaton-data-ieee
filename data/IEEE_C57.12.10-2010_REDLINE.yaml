abstract:
- content: 'This standard sets forth the requirements for power transformer application.
    This standard is intended to be used as a basis for performance, interchangeability,
    and safety of the equipment covered and to assist in the proper selection of such
    equipment. This document is a product standard that covers certain electrical,
    dimensional, and mechanical characteristics of 50 Hz and 60 Hz, liquid-immersed
    power transformers and autotransformers. Such power transformers may be remotely
    or integrally associated with either primary switchgear or substations, or both,
    for step-down or step-up purposes and base rated as follows: 833 kVA and above
    single-phase, 750 kVA and above three-phase. This standard applies to all liquid-immersed
    power transformers and autotransformers that do not belong to the following types
    of apparatus: instrument transformers, step voltage and induction voltage regulators,
    arc-furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding
    transformers, mobile transformers, and mine transformers. An errata is available
    at http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/errata/C57.12.10-2010_errata.pdf'
