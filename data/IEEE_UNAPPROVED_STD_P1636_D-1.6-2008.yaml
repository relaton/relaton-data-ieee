abstract:
- content: implementation independent specification for a software interface to information
    systems containing data pertinent to the diagnosis and maintenance of complex
    systems consisting of hardware, software, or any combination thereof. These interfaces
    will support service definitions for creating application programming interfaces
    (API) for the access, exchange, and analysis of historical diagnostic and maintenance
    information. The standard will use the information models of IEEE Std 1232-2002
    - Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service Tie to All Test Environments (AI-ESTATE)
    as a foundation.
