abstract:
- content: Guidelines to specify, procure, design, manufacture and develop manuals,
    safety procedures, practices and procedures for effective maintenance of medium-voltage
    direct current (MVDC) electrical power systems are discussed in this recommended
    practice. Recommendations are made for analytical methods, preferred interconnection
    interfaces and performance characteristics for reliable integration of MVDC electrical
    components into the ship MVDC electrical power systems.
