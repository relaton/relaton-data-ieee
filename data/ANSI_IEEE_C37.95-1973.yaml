abstract:
- content: This guide has been prepared to aid in the effective and uniform application
    of fuses, relays, and their associated switching equipment located at the point
    of interconnection between the utility and the consumer electrical systems. Descriptions
    of the various devices, definitions of terms, and references to other technical
    technical publications have been included to make the guide useful not only to
    relay engineers, but also to other technical people who may not be intimately
    familiar with the art of relaying, but who nevertheless have a responsibility
    for the installation and operation of such interconnections. It includes examples
    for relaying of typical installations, both with and without consumer generation,
    and with service from utility radial or loop feeders, either directly from the
    utility substation bus or from a transmission line. It is expected that the guide
    will be used by consulting engineers, utility relay and sales engineers, and by
    consumer engineering and maintenance personnel.
