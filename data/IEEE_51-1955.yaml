abstract:
- content: The service record of electric equipment depends largely upon the performance
    of its insulation. Insulation failures result from various combinations of such
    causes as progressive aging, moisture, mechanical damage, excess temperature,
    chemical action and abnormal voltage stresses. Commercial tests involving all
    these factors are impractical. It has long been the practice, however, to test
    new insulation at a voltage appreciably greater than its rated operating voltage.
    The dielectric test voltages should be chosen to result in good operating performance
    and satisfactory life. The establishment of suitable dielectric test specifications
    involves consideration of the over voltages to which equipment is subjected in
    service, a study of equipment strength and protective methods and a correlation
    of the dielectric test voltages and the performance of equipment in service.
