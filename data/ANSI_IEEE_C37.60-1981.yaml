abstract:
- content: This standard applies to all overhead, pad mounted, dry vault and submersible
    single or multi-pole alternating current automatic circuit reclosers and fault
    interrupters for rated maximum voltages above 1000 V. In order to simplify this
    standard where possible, the term recloser has been substituted for automatic
    circuit recloser or fault interrupter or both.
