abstract:
- content: A two-terminal avalanche junction surge suppressor for surge-protective
    application on systems with dc to 420-Hz frequency and voltages equal to or less
    than 1000 V rms or 1200 V dc is considered. The device is a single package that
    may be assembled from any combination of series and/or parallel diode chips. Definitions,
    service conditions, and a series of test criteria for determining its electrical
    characteristics are provided. These devices are used as surge diverters for limiting
    transient overvoltages in power and communications circuits.
