abstract:
- content: Portable/benchtop test equipment applications are supported in this document
    by defining a mass interconnection scheme and pin configuration based upon IEEE
    Std 1505(TM)-2010 and IEEE Std 1505.1(TM)-2015. Particular emphasis has been placed
    on defining a more specific set of performance requirements than is defined by
    IEEE Std 1505-2010 and IEEE Std 1505.1-2015. These performance requirements are
    in the areas of the pin configuration, specific connector modules, and respective
    contacts.
