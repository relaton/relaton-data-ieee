abstract:
- content: This standard specifies how all or part of a network can be secured transparently
    to peer protocol entities that use the MAC Service provided by IEEE 802&#174;
    LANs to communicate. MAC security (MACsec) provides connectionless user data confidentiality,
    frame data integrity, and data origin authenticity.
