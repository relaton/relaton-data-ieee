abstract:
- content: A suggested set of limits that may find general application is set forth.
    A rationale for developing limits is presented, and a set of limits that are representative
    of current practice is recommended. Environmental radio noise and the selection
    of measurement parameters are described. The measurement of amplitude distribution,
    the measurement set envelope amplitude distribution, and the amplitude probability
    distribution are discussed in the appendixes.
