abstract:
- content: This recommended practice aims to expand the use of IEEE power distribution
    test 6 feeders into a broader space of software developers, software users, and
    researchers. The need for new distribution software functionality evolves quickly
    in areas such as distributed resource modeling, load response to voltage and frequency,
    reliability improvement, neutral-earth voltage, active controls, interoperability,
    etc. By leveraging and expanding the set of test feeders, more attention can focus
    on providing the new functionality. The scope of the recommended practice includes
    steady-state, event-based, probabilistic, stochastic, and dynamic analysis of
    electric utility power distribution systems. Industrial and commercial power distribution
    systems, harmonic analysis, and electromagnetic transient analysis are all excluded.
