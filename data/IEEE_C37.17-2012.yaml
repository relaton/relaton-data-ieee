abstract:
- content: Requirements for direct acting current and voltage protective functions
    of direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices, direct-acting overcurrent
    electronic trip systems, reverse-current trip systems for dc circuit breakers,
    and undervoltage trip devices that are integral with low-voltage ac (1000 V and
    below) and general purpose low-voltage dc (1500 and below) power circuit breakers
    covered by IEEE Std C37.13<sup>TM</sup>, IEEE Std C37.14<sup>TM</sup>, and IEEE
    Std C37.16<sup>TM</sup> are included in this standard. Additional information,
    communication and/or additional internal or external protective functions or devices
    are not covered (but also not restricted) by this standard.
