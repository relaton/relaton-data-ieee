abstract:
- content: This recommended practice describes data supporting the reliability evaluation
    of existing industrial and commercial power systems. It is likely to be of greatest
    value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience in the area of reliability.
    It can also be an aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of
    industrial and commercial power systems.
