abstract:
- content: A standard is defined for setting up and operationalizing a data-trading
    system (DTS) to trade data through a domain-independent and principled marketplace
    under a unified architecture. Definitions and specifications for stakeholders,
    relevant external entities, and objects; definitions of the reference model, trading
    terms, functional and non-functional requirements to operate a DTS; and an overview
    of the data trading via the DTS are provided. These are foundational for operationalizing
    a data-trading system that allows data trading among multiple stakeholders.
