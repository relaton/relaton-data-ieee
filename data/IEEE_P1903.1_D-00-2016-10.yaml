abstract:
- content: Protocols to support advanced content delivery capability in next generation
    service overlay networks including content delivery (CD) functional entity (FE),
    service routing (SR) FE, service policy decision (SPD) FE, service discovery and
    negotiation (SDN) FE, and context information management (CIM) FE are specified
    in this standard. Content discovery, content cache and storage management, content
    delivery control, and transport QoS control, including contextaware and dynamically
    adaptive content delivery operations, are supported by the content delivery capability.
