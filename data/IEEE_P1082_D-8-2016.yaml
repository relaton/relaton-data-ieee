abstract:
- content: A structured framework for the incorporation of human reliability analysis
    (HRA) into probabilistic risk assessments (PRAs) is provided in this guide. To
    enhance the analysis of human/system interactions in PRAs, to help ensure reproducible
    conclusions, and to standardize the documentation of such assessments are the
    purposes of this guide. To do this, a specific HRA framework is developed from
    standard practices. The HRA framework is neutral with respect to specific HRA
    methods.
