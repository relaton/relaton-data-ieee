abstract:
- content: A rationale and recommendations for developing emission limits and immunity
    test levels are presented in this recommended practice. These limits and levels
    are representative of current practice and user needs. Emission limits are specified
    by national and international standards bodies. Emission limits for the most part
    are regulated and hence controlled, which is the case in the U.S. and Canada.
    Such regulatory limits take precedence, even if the limits are different from
    those considered in this document. For product immunity, while in some parts of
    the world this is regulated, for the U.S. and Canada, it is not regulated except
    for some types of safety equipment. In this way, adequate immunity is more a quality
    aspect of the product because it does not operate in its intended RF environment,
    the user would deem it of poor design and quality. The immunity test levels described
    in this document are representative of common levels applied internationally.
    However, severe environments (in which levels of electromagnetic disturbance are
    high) require the consideration of applying higher test levels. This consideration
    is described in this recommended practice. Finally, it should be noted that the
    entire recommended practice does not contain normative requirements, as such practices
    remain optional.
