abstract:
- content: This draft standard covers contractual interactions and agreements between
    individuals and the service providers they engage on a network, including websites.
    It describes how individuals, acting as first parties, can proffer their privacy
    requirements as contractual terms and arrive at agreements recorded and kept by
    both sides. These terms shall be chosen from a collection of standard-form agreements
    in a roster kept by an independent and neutral non-business entity. Computing
    devices and software performing as agents for both first and second parties shall
    engage using any protocol that serves the purpose. The first party shall point
    to a preferred agreement, or a set of agreements, from which the second party
    shall accept one. Party-to-party negotiations over terms in any of these contracts
    or other agreements are outside the scope of this standard. If both parties agree,
    the chosen contract or agreement shall be signed electronically by both parties
    or their agents, and a matching record shall be kept by both sides in a form that
    can be retrieved, audited, or disputed, if necessary, at some later time—and which
    is available to do so easily.
