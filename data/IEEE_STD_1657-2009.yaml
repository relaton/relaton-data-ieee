abstract:
- content: This recommended practice defines the areas of recommended knowledge for
    installers and maintainers of stationary batteries and related systems to the
    extent that they affect the battery. Design of the dc system and sizing of the
    dc battery charger(s) are beyond the scope of this recommended practice. This
    document covers lead-acid and nickel-cadmium battery technologies.
