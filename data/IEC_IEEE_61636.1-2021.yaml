abstract:
- content: Promoting and facilitating interoperability between components of automatic
    test systems where test results need to be shared is addressed in this standard.
    The standard thus facilitates the capture of test results data in storage devices
    and databases, facilitating online and offline analysis. The test results schema
    becomes a class of information that can be used within the SIMICA family of standards.
    The exchange format is expressed in both the OWL and XML formats.
