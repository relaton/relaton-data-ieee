abstract:
- content: This standard specifies procedures and managed objects for quality of service
    (QoS) features specified in IEEE Std 802.1Q, such as Per-Stream Filtering and
    Policing, queuing, transmission selection, stream control, and frame preemption,
    in a network system that is not a Bridge. (The PDF of this standard is available
    at no cost compliments of the IEEE GET program https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=68)
