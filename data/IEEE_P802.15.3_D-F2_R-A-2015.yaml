abstract:
- content: The protocol and compatible interconnection of data and multimedia communication
    equipment via 2.4 GHz and 60 GHz radio transmissions in a Wireless Personal Area
    Network (WPAN) using low power and multiple modulation formats to support scalable
    data rates is defined in this standard. The Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer
    protocol supports both isochronous and asynchronous data types.
