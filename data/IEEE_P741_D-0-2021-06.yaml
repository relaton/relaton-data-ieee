abstract:
- content: Criteria that establish protection requirements for Class 1E power systems
    and equipment are prescribed in this standard. The purpose of and the means for
    obtaining protection from electrical and mechanical damage, or failures that can
    occur within a time period that is shorter than that required for operator action,
    are described. Testing and surveillance requirements are included. Plant physical
    design requirements to protect against events such as pipe whip, fire, dropped
    load, etc., are not included.
