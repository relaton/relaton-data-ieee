abstract:
- content: This standard applies to rotating electric machinery which forms part of
    the propulsion and major auxiliary equipment on internally and externally powered
    electrically propelled rail and road vehicles and similar large transport and
    haulage vehicles and their trailers where speciÞed in the contract. Major auxiliary
    equipment includes equipment such as blower and compressor motors, motor-generator
    and motoralternator sets, auxiliary generators, and exciters, usually larger than
    3 kilowatts.
