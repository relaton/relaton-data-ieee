abstract:
- content: Aspects of fault models as they are relevant to the generation of test
    patterns for digital circuits are formalized in this standard. Fault counting,
    fault classification, and fault coverage reporting across different automatic
    test pattern generation (ATPG) tools, for the single stuck-at fault model are
    included in the scope. It shall be incumbent for fault coverage to be reported
    in a uniform way on all ATPG tools (that comply with this standard). The generation
    of a uniform coverage (and, hence, a uniform test quality) metric for large chips
    [including systems-on-chips (SOCs)] with different cores and modules for which
    test patterns have been independently generated will be facilitated by this standard.
