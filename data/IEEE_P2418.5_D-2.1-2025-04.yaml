abstract:
- content: Blockchain / Distributed Ledger Technology, referred to as Blockchain/DLT,
    is a proven technology in industry and, though newer to applications in the energy
    industry, is well-positioned to become a critical component of this evolving electrical
    system. Blockchain/DLT can provide transparency and traceability within energy
    markets and distributed system operations, reduce error and processing inefficiencies
    between the multiple parties engaged in interconnected grid management, and offer
    a path to automation of the grid through the use of smart contracts. This guide
    provides an open, common, and interoperable reference framework model for distributed
    ledger technology (DLT) such as blockchain in the energy sector. This Guide also
    serves as a guideline for Blockchain DLT use cases in the electrical power industry,
    creating a guide for a reference architecture framework, including interoperability,
    terminology, functionality, and system interfaces for blockchain DLT applications
    in the energy sector.
