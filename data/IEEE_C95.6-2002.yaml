abstract:
- content: Recommendations are given to prevent harmful effects in human beings exposed
    to electromagnetic fields in the frequency range of 0­3 kHZ. The recommendations
    are intended to apply to exposures of the general public, as well as to individuals
    in controlled environments. They are not intended to apply to the purposeful exposure
    of patients by or under the direction of practitioners of the healing arts and
    may not be protective with respect to the use of medical devices or implants.
    A rationale that describes how the recommendations were arrived at, and the factors
    taken into account in formulating them, is included.
