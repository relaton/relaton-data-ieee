abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Feb 06, 2006. This standard describes
    a utility telemetry service architecture operated over the telephone network.
    The architecture described is a basic transport architecture capable of supporting
    many different applications. The text is described in terms of a utility meter
    reading application, but any enhanced service provider (ESP) communication can
    be transported. Telemetry calls may be initiated by either the utility/service
    provider (outbound) or the telemetry interface unit (TIU)/CPE (inbound) on the
    end user''s premise.'
