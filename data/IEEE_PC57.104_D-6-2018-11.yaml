abstract:
- content: 'Detailed procedures for interpreting Dissolved Gas Analysis results are
    described. The document details: 1) Overview of gas generation in transformer
    and DGA process. 2) The purpose and application of DGA. 3) DGA quality verification
    and DGA limitations. 5) DGA interpretation and norms. 6) Fault type definitions
    and identification. 7) Case studies and interpretation example. The intent is
    to provide the operator with useful information concerning the serviceability
    of the equipment. An extensive bibliography on gas evolution, detection, and interpretation
    is included.'
