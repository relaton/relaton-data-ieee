abstract:
- content: Traction power systems experience some of the most extreme variations in
    local power loads as compared to most other large scale electric power supply
    networks. These variations create challenges in the construction of reliable electric
    power delivery systems and in the performance of the rolling stock dependent on
    power supplied by the system. Energy storage offers a solution by smoothing out
    these power variations, absorbing energy as system voltage rises and delivering
    energy as voltage drops. This guide will help engineers in identifying where these
    solutions can provide the greatest benefits, designing solutions with the greatest
    impact,and quantifying the costs/benefits of deploying new solutions.
