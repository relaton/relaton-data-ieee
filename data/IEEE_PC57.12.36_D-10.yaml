abstract:
- content: This project is to develop a standard for 50 and 60 Hz liquid immersed
    distribution substation transformers with ratings of 10 000 kVA and below three
    phase, 6667 kVA and below single phase with a primary voltage 69 000 and below,
    and a secondary voltage of 34 500 and below. The standard will cover indoor/outdoor
    application, cover/wall terminations and switchgear coordination issues.
