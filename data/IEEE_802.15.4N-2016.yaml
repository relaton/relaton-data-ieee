abstract:
- content: The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) of the Peoples
    Republic of China has approved the 174-216 MHz, 407-425 MHz, and 608-630 MHz bands
    for medical information transmission. China medical band (CMB) devices operating
    within these bands conform to a set of rules specified in MIIT Doc 423-2005, which
    restricts use of the band to only medical, non-voice use under direction of a
    healthcare practitioner, among other requirements. A physical layer (PHY) for
    devices operating on Chinese approved bands for medical signals is defined in
    this amendment.
