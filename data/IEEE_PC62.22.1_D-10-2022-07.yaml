abstract:
- content: Surge arrester installation methods at distribution cable terminal poles
    to minimize the total impressed transient voltage on medium-voltage distribution
    cables are suggested in this guide. Grounding electrode techniques, pole ground
    values, and system ground grid values are not addressed or considered in this
    document.
