abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides recommendations for the design and coordinated
    deployment of fixed broadband wireless access systems in order to control interference
    and facilitate coexistence. It analyzes appropriate coexistence scenarios and
    provides guidance for system design, deployment, coordination, and frequency usage.
    It generally addresses licensed spectrum between 2 GHz and 66 GHz, with a detailed
    emphasis on 3.5 GHz, 10.5 GHz, and 23.5 &#8211; 43.5 GHz.
