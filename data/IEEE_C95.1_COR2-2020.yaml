abstract:
- content: Technical corrections are addressed in this corrigendum. Figure 1 and Figure
    2 in IEEE Std C95.1-2019 were found to be incorrect. They did not accurately portray
    the limits given in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4. The figures were corrected
    with respect to frequency extent and breakpoints to be consistent with the tables.
