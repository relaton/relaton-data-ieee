abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Jan 15, 2001. No longer endorsed by
    the IEEE. An 8-bit microcomputer bus system derived from the industry bus known
    as the STD bus is described. The STD bus is a modular packaging and interconnect
    scheme for 8-bit microprocessor card systems. The bus size and bus organization
    were selected to serve the interface between any 8-bit microprocessor and a variety
    of memory and I/O functions. Logical, timing, electrical, and mechanical specifications
    are provided. The body of the standard provides a core specification for the device-independent
    parameters. Appendixes provide device-dependent parameters for various processors.
    This document also contains ANSI/IEEE Std 1101-1987, IEEE Standard for Mechanical
    Core Specifications for Microcomputers.'
