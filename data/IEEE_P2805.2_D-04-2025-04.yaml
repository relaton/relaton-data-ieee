abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the protocols used by the edge computing node for
    buffering, filtering, and pre-processing data collected from industrial controllers
    on the shop floor, including programmable logic controllers, microcontrollers,
    industrial robots, etc. The data acquisition from field devices with different
    interfaces must be automatically stored, filtered, and pre-processed according
    to reconfigurable rules, including buffering data from selected time frames, converting
    data formats, and filtering invalid data from industrial clouds and other edge
    computing nodes.
