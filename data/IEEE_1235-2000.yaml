    are establishedin this guide. Included are various methods of identifying underground
    power cables and ducts, andthe visual, chemical, and mechanical properties of
    the identification materials and/or methods, andtheir impact on the properties
    of the overall jacket or duct as well as their impact on installationpractices.
