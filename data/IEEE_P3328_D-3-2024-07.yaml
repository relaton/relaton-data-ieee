abstract:
- content: An application of wheeled robots for substation inspection and live detection
    is provided by this recommended practice. A system composition, application scenarios,
    functional and performance requirements, methods for inspection and detection
    operations, calibration and acceptance, and maintenance and repair requirements
    are provided. This recommended practice is applicable to wheeled robots used in
    both ac and dc substation inspection and live detection.
