abstract:
- content: Ratings, performance requirements, and compliance test methods are provided
    for ac high-voltage generator circuit breakers rated on a symmetrical current
    basis that are installed between the generator and the transformer terminals.
    Guidance for applying generator circuit breakers is given. Pumped storage installations
    are considered a special application, and their requirements are not completely
    covered by this standard.
