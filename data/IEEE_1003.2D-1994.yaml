abstract:
- content: This amendment is part of the POSIX series of standards for applications
    and user interfaces to open systems. It is a supplement to IEEE Std 1003.2-1992,
    which defines the applications interface to a shell command language and a set
    of utility programs for complex data manipulation. This supplement defines the
    user interface to a distributed batch queuing environment and includes application
    environments..
