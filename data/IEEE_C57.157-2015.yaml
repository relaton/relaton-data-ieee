abstract:
- content: This guide is intended for use in establishing a methodology to evaluate
    expected long-term performance of infrequently operated switch contacts used within
    insulating liquidimmersed transformers. These switch contacts are typically found
    in de-energized tapchangers, dual voltage switches, reversing switches, on-load
    tapchangers, and step-voltage regulators, but the test might possibly be used
    to evaluate any contact that is used in insulating liquids with similar operating
    characteristics and within similar environments.
