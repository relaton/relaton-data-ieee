abstract:
- content: Voltage conditions that may arise at publicly and privately accessible
    locations as a result of the delivery and use of electrical energy are addressed
    in this guide. This guide is not intended for use as a statement of cause and
    effect. It focuses primarily on the presence of power frequency related voltage
    conditions and discusses definitions, sources, testing techniques, and strategies
    that may be available to help reduce those conditions.
