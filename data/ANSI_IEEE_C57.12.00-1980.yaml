abstract:
- content: 'This standard is intended as a basis for the establishment of performance,
    limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and safety requirements
    of equipment described; and for assistance in the proper selection of such equipment.
    This standard describes electrical, mechanical, and safety requirements of liquid-immersed
    distribution and power transformers, and autotransformers and regulating transformers;
    single and polyphase, with voltage 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding.
    This standard applies to all liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating
    transformers except as indicated below: (1) Instrument transformers. (2) Step-voltage
    and induction voltage regulators. (3) Arc furnace transformers. (4) Rectifier
    transformers. (5) Specialty transformers. (6) Grounding transformers. (7) Mobile
    transformers. (8) Mine transformers. When this standard is used on a mandatory
    basis, the words shall and must indicates mandatory requirements; and the words
    should and may refer to matters which are recommended or permissive, but not mandatory.'
