abstract:
- content: This standard does not include data on shaft stress limits, materials,
    or bolt tensioning For historical purposes, the legacy shaft dimensional requirements
    of superseded IEEE Standard 810-1987 are included in Annex A for use by hydroelectric
    plant owners, operators and designers involved in the disassembly and re-assembly
    of hydraulic turbines and generators. These legacy systems, primarily installed
    in North American facilities, generally employ US customary units of measurement.
