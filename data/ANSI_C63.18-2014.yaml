abstract:
- content: A guide to evaluating electromagnetic immunity of medical devices against
    radiated radio-frequency (RF) emissions from common RF transmitters is provided
    in this recommended practice (e.g., two-way radios; walkie-talkies; mobile phones;
    wireless-enabled tablets, e-readers, laptop computers, and similar devices; RFID
    readers; networked mp3 players; two-way pagers; and wireless personal digital
    assistants [PDAs]). A comprehensive test or a guarantee is not provided by this
    protocol but, instead, a basic evaluation is given that can help identify medical
    devices that might be particularly vulnerable to interference from common RF transmitters.
    Existing or newly purchased medical devices can be evaluated by this ad hoc test
    protocol or the protocol can be implemented for prepurchase evaluation. This recommended
    practice applies to medical devices used in health-care facilities but can also
    be adapted to medical devices in home health-care or mobile health-care settings.
    It does not apply to implantable medical devices (e.g., pacemakers and defibrillators),
    transport environments such as ambulances and helicopters, or RF transmitters
    rated at more than 8 W of output power. Testing with transmitters greater than
    8 W in health-care facilities is not recommended because of possible adverse effects
    on criticalcare medical devices that are in use in nearby areas of the facility.
    Finally, in-band RF interference where the fundamental frequency of an RF transmitter
    overlaps with frequencies used by a hospital wireless network or monitoring or
    other medical device wireless links is not addressed by this recommended practice.
