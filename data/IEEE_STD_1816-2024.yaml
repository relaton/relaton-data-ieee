abstract:
- content: Accepted best industry practices for the preparation of shielded medium
    voltage cables rated 2.5 kV through 46 kV for the installation of mating accessories
    are defined in this guide. The information is intended to supplement cable accessory
    manufacturer installation instructions. The contents of the guide aim to provide
    a single source covering the proper methods to prepare cables for termination
    and jointing to maximize long-term, reliable operation of electrical power cable
    systems.
