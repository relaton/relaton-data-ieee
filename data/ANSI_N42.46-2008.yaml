- content: This standard is intended to be used to determine the imaging performance
    of X-ray and gamma-ray systems utilized to inspect loaded or empty vehicles, including
    personal and commercial vehicles of any type; marine and air cargo containers
    of any size; railroad cars; and palletized or unpalletized cargo larger than 1
    m times 1 m in cross-section.
