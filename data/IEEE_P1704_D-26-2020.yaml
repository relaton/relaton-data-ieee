abstract:
- content: This standard is an extension to IEEE Std 1703(TM). Physical hardware interfaces
    and signals, such as logical interface and power (digital and mains), that link
    metrology devices to communications modules via the USB physical layer are specified
    in this standard. The communication module described in this standard is not integral
    (not on the same circuit board) with the metrology registers (circuit board) of
    the assembly. However, the module is envisioned to partner with a device implementing
    measurement registers (energy, demand load, power quality and related quantities)
    that are semantically modeled using IEEE Std 1377&#8482;, and encapsulated for
    communication using IEEE Std 1703(TM)application layer messages.
