abstract:
- content: Identified in the 2014 published version of IEEE Std C57.12.38 is an error.
    Tw0 dimensions were provided for the high-voltage bushing height above the base
    of the transformer. The lower dimension (597+114/-13) should have been designated
    as being for units 167 kVA and 250 kVA only. The error is corrected in this corrigendum.
