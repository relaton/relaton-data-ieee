abstract:
- content: The purpose of these definitions is to foster uniformity and standardization
    of language among engineers engaged in reporting, analyzing, and predicting outages
    of transmission and distribution facilities and interruptions to customers. While
    the proposed definitions are not intended to be specific instructions for reporting
    outages of facilities and interruptions to customers, use of standardized definitions
    should facilitate exchanges of data between workers in the field. The preparation
    of standard definitions of terms may be regarded as a first step before pooling
    of data between utilities can be successfully accomplished. The work of preparing
    this publication was carried out by a task force of the System Operations Subcommittee
    of the Power System Engineering Committee of the IEEE Power Engineering Society.
