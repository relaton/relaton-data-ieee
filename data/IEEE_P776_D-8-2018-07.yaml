abstract:
- content: The inductive environment that exists in the vicinity of electric power
    and wire-line telecommunications systems and the interfering effects that may
    be produced are addressed. An interface that permits either party, without need
    to involve the other, to verify the induction at the interface by use of a probe
    wire is presented. This recommended practice does not apply to railway signal
    circuits.
