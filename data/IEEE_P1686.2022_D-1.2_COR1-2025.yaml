abstract:
- content: The functions and features to be provided in intelligent electronic devices
    (IEDs) to accommodate cybersecurity programs are defined in this standard. Security
    regarding access, operation, configuration, firmware revision, and data retrieval
    from an IED are addressed. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of external
    interfaces of the IED are also addressed. This corrigendum clarifies the definition
    of value forcing and updates outdated bibliographic references.
