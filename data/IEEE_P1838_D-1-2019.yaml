abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1838 is a die-centric standard; it applies to a die that is intended
    to be part of a multi-die stack. This standard defines die-level features that,
    when compliant dies are brought together in a stack, comprise a stack-level architecture
    that enables transportation of control and data signals for the test of (1) intra-die
    circuitry and (2) inter-die interconnects in both (a) pre-stacking and (b) post-stacking
    situations, the latter for both partial and complete stacks in both pre-packaging,
    post-packaging, and board-level situations. The primary focus of inter-die interconnect
    technology addressed by this standard is through-silicon vias (TSVs); however,
    this does not preclude its use with other interconnect technologies such as wire-bonding
