abstract:
- content: Very low frequency (VLF) withstand and other diagnostic tests and measurements
    that are performed using VLF energization in the field on shielded power cable
    systems are described in this guide. Whenever possible, cable systems are treated
    in a similar manner to individual cables. Tables are included as an aid to identifying
    the effectiveness of the VLF ac voltage test for various cable system insulation
    problems.
