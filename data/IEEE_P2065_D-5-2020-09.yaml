abstract:
- content: The required parameters that should be included in an industrial fiber
    laser product, such as the terminology, classification, and test method for fiber
    laser products are specified in this guide. This guide is intended to be used
    by fiber-laser producers, laser-processing equipment integrators, and end-users.
    This standard specifies performance parameters and the test method for industrial
    fiber lasers. The purpose is to improve the mutual compatibility among laser manufacturers,
    system integrators and end users, provide a uniform specification, and promote
    the development of the industrial fiber laser sector.
