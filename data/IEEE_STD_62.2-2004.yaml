abstract:
- content: This is a guide for determining applicable tests and inspection techniques
    for various types of large rotating electric machines. It provides short discussions
    relating to the capabilities and limitations of each test, typical test procedures
    and in some cases, how to interpret the expected range of results. This is to
    be a companion document to P62 Part 1-1995
