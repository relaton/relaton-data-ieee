abstract:
- content: The purpose of the report is to establish uniform methods for determining
    the capability of transformers to supply nonsinusoidal load currents, without
    loss of normal life expectancy. Two methods are described. The first is intended
    for use by those with access to detailed information on loss density distribution
    within the transformer windings. The second is less accurate and is intended for
    use by those with access to transformer certified test report data only. It is
    anticipated that the first method will be used primarily by transformer design
    engineers, while the second will be employed primarily by users. This recommended
    practice will be applicable for evaluating the feasibility of applying nonsinusoidal
    load currents to existing transformers and for specifying new transformers to
    supply nonsinusoidal loads.
