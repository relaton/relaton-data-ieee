abstract:
- content: Specifications of common public key cryptographic techniques based on hard
    problems over lattices supplemental to those considered in IEEE Std 1363-2000
    and IEEE Std 1363a-2004, including mathematical primitives for secret value (key)
    derivation, public key encryption, identification and digital signatures, and
    cryptographic schemes based on those primitives are provided. Also presented are
    specifications of related cryptographic parameters, public keys, and private keys.
    Class of computer and communications systems is not restricted.
