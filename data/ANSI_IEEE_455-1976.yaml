abstract:
- content: Telephone companies and equipment manufacturers have generally agreed on
    a definition for longitudinal balance for many years. This agreement extends also
    to the basic approach followed when measuring balance. Testing a device for balance
    involves the application of a longitudinal voltage. Then any resulting metallic
    voltage is measured, and the ratio of the two voltages is used to develop a balance
    number.Unfortunately, agreement has ended at about this point. A number of different
    test circuits are used by different segments of the telephone industry. Although
    all of the existing test circuits have some merits supporting their use, the mere
    existence of varied circuits leads to differences in test results.In addition
    to differences related to the test set, test conditions and procedures can also
    affect the result. When an item of equipment is to be tested, there is often a
    test set or procedure,or both, capable of giving any desired result.Agreement
    on one way of testing for longitudinal balance has been sought. This standard
    represents such agreement. It defines the basic requirements of a standard test
    circuit. Reasonable tolerances are included so that a test-set designer will find
    considerable latitude to make the set his own way. Besides defining the requirements
    for a test circuit, this standard includes test conditions and procedures that
    must be established and followed. As a result, all test sets designed and used
    in accordance with the standard will produce the same balance number for a given
    test specimen. Similarly, comparing balance numbers for different devices will
    become more meaningful when all come from tests meeting the standard.
