- content: This standard is part of the POSIX¨ series of standards for applications
    and user interfaces to open systems. It defines the applications interface to
    a shell command language and a set of utility programs for complex manipulation.
    When the User Portability Utilities Option is included, the standard also defines
    a common environment for general-purpose time-sharing users on character-oriented
    display terminals.
