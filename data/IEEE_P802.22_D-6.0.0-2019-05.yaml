abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the air interface, including the cognitive medium
    access control layer (MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of point&#8211;to&#8211;multipoint
    wireless regional area networks (WRANs) comprised of a professional fixed base
    station (BS) with fixed and portable user terminals operating in the VHF/UHF TV
    broadcast bands between 54 MHz to 862 MHz, and potentially in the 1300 MHz to
    1750 MHz, and 2700 MHz to 3700 MHz bands provided the regulatory regime allows
    it.
