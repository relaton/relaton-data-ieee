abstract:
- content: This document defines the areas of recommended knowledge for installers
    and maintainers of stationary batteries and related systems to the extent that
    they affect the battery. Design of the dc system and sizing of the dc battery
    charger(s) are beyond the scope of this document. This document covers only lead-acid
    and nickel-cadmium battery technologies. Its purpose is to provide an outline
    (not necessarily in training order) of the items that should be covered by those
    developing training programs for stationary battery installation and maintenance
    personnel. The IEEE will not be certifying trained personnel nor providing its
    own battery technician training programs.
