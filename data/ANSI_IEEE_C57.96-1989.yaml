abstract:
- content: The guide covers general recommendations for the loading of dry-type distribution
    and power transformers that have 80 degrees C, 115 degrees C, and 150 degrees
    C average winding rises and insulation systems limited to 150 degrees C, 185 degrees
    C, and 220 degrees C maximum hottest-spot operating temperatures respectively.,
    The guide includes recommendations for ventilated, nonventilated, and sealed dry-type
    transformers having impregnated insulation systems. If the user desires more specific
    recommendations for a particular transformer, the manufacturer of that transformer
    should be consulted.<<ETX>>
