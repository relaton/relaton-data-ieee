abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C57 family on Power Distribution
    and Regulating Transformers. A test procedure for determining the temperature
    classification of ventilated dry-type power and distribution transformer insulation
    systems by test rather than by chemical composition is established. The intent
    is to provide a uniform method for providing data for selection of the temperature
    classification of the insulation system, for providing data that may be used as
    a basis for a loading guide, and for comparative evaluation of different insulation
    systems. Voltage-withstand endpoint criteria are related to the impulse voltage
    distribution within the coil or to the initial voltage-withstand of the coil.
    A relationship between impulse withstand of the insulation and short-term 60-Hz-withstand
    is identified so that 50/60--Hz testing of model coils is possible.
