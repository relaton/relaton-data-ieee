abstract:
- content: 'IEC 61523-3: 2004 Dual-logo document. Replaces IEEE Std 1497-2001. The
    Standard Delay Format (SDF) is defined in this standard. SDF is a textual file
    format for representing the delay and timing information of electronic systems.
    While both human and machine readable, in its most common usage it will be machine
    written and machine read in support of timing analysis and verification tools,
    and of other tools requiring delay and timing information. The primary audience
    for this standard is the implementors of tools supporting the format, but anyone
    with a need to understand the format’s contents will find it useful.'
