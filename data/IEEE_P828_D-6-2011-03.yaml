abstract:
- content: This standard establishes the minimum 1 required processes for Software
    and Systems Configuration Management (SSCM). The application of this standard
    applies to any form, class, or type of software or system. (It does not address
    the hardware components of systems.) This revision of the standard expands the
    previous version to explain the processes involved in SSCM, including identifying
    and acquiring configuration items, controlling changes, reporting the status of
    configuration items, as well as software builds and release engineering. Its predecessor
    defined only the contents of a software configuration management plan. This standard
    addresses what SSCM activities are to be done, when they are to happen in the
    lifecycle, and what planning and resources are required. It also describes the
    content areas for an SSCM Plan. The standard supports IEEE/EIA Std 12207 and IEEE/EIA
    Std 15288 and adheres to the terminology in ISO/IEC/IEEE Std 24765 and the information
    requirements of IEEE Std 15289.
