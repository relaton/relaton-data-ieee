abstract:
- content: The recommended specification was updated to include the latest practices
    on the North American continent and the title was changed from a recommended specification
    to a "Recommended Practice for Preparation of Equipment Specifications. "Insofar
    as possible, the Practice has been made consistent with the ASME Performance Test
    CodePTC29-1965 and the draft of the corresponding IEC document.
