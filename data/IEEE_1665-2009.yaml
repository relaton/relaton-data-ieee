abstract:
- content: The general parameters for this guide apply to 50 Hz or 60 Hz synchronous
    generators driven by reciprocating engines, steam turbines, combustion turbines,
    and hydro turbines. The guide generally applies to the stator and rotor of generators
    with rated outputs of 1 MVA and above. The guide does not address machine auxiliaries
    or the excitation system.
