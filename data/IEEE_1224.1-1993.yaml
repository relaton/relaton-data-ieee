abstract:
- content: Application program interfaces (APIs) to X.400-based electronic messaging
    services are defined in terms that are independent of any particular programming
    language. A general-purpose API that makes the functionality of a message transfer
    system (MTS) accessible to a message store (MS) or user agent (UA), or the functionality
    of a simple MS accessible to a UA, is provided. An X.400 gateway API divides a
    message transfer agent (MTA) into two software components, a messaging system
    gateway and an X.400 gateway service. This standard, and the language bindings
    derived from it, are intended to be used in conjunction with IEEE Std 1224-1993,
    which provides a general-purpose API for the creation, examination, modification,
    and deletion of OSI information objects.
