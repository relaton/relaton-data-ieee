abstract:
- content: This recommended practice and guide 1 specifies an energy-efficient functional
    architecture for big data transmission and processing. The architecture considers
    distributed processing nodes in addition to centralized data centers to process
    big data chunks. Distributed processing nodes provides processing closer to big
    data sources which reduces the networking power consumption. The performance of
    the energy-efficient functional architecture is compared to classical centralized
    processing of big data under different use cases representing two of the main
    characteristics of big data; volume and variety.
