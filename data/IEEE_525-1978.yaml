abstract:
- content: 'Thep lose of this guide is to: (1) Outline requirements and establish
    design guides for the application and installation of control and low-voltage
    power cables in electric power transmission and distribution substations, emphasizing
    electrical service with maximum reliability during the entire life of the substation
    (2) Provide references to industry standard design specifications for control
    and low-voltage power cables suitable for use in substations (3) Provide a comprehensive
    bibliography of literature related to the subject.'
