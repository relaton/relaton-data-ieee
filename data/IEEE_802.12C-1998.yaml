abstract:
- content: Standard withdrawn 14 January 2001. Optional MAC capabilities are defined
    to allow direct link connection between two end nodes with provision for both
    half-duplex and full-duplex operation; burst-mode packet transmission from an
    end node to a repeater where the end node may send one or more packets each time
    it is granted permission to transmit; and implementation of the MAC Control sublayer
    to allow the exchange of control requests between peer MAC entities across the
    network when in ISO/IEC 8802-3 compatibility mode. Full interoperability is maintained
    with existing ISO/IEC 8802-12 products.
