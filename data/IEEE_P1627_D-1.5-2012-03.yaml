abstract:
- content: This standard is a basis for the design and application of dc surge protection
    devices to assist in protecting Overhead Contact System (OCS) from transient overvoltages
    associated with lightning and switching surges. Switching surges are inherent
    characteristics of electrification system and are generally considered low energy
    transient overvoltages. Lightning surges are natural, caused by electrical discharge
    that occurs in the atmosphere between clouds or between clouds and ground. Lightning
    surges are known for causing very high energy transient overvoltages by direct
    or indirect coupling with OCS. This standard covers transient overvoltage protection
    of OCS used in dc transit rail electrification systems. Transient overvoltage
    protection of third rail dc and the running rails may be achieved by the application
    of same type of surge protection devices as are recommended for the OCS, although
    these rails are generally less likely to be affected by lightning transient overvoltages
    due to their proximity to earth where flash-over can occur to drain surge energy
    away from the rails without the application of surge overvoltage protection devices.
    The word surge arrester instead of lightning arrester has been used in this standard
    without affecting the technical contents of the standard.
