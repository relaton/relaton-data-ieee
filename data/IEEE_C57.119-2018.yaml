abstract:
- content: Recommendations are made, where possible, regarding the performance and
    evaluation of temperature rise tests on liquid-immersed power transformers beyond
    nameplate ratings in this recommended practice. The intent is to assist power
    transformer manufacturers, and the ultimate users, in evaluating thermal performance
    of the transformers under varying loads.
