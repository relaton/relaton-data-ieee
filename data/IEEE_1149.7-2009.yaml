abstract:
- content: This specification describes circuitry that may be added to an integrated
    circuit to provide access to on-chip test access ports (TAPs) specified by IEEE
    Std 1149.1¿-2001. The circuitry uses IEEE 1149.1-2001 as its foundation, providing
    complete backward compatibility, while aggressively adding features to support
    test and applications debug. It defines six classes of 1149.7 test access ports
    (TAP.7s), T0-T5, with each class providing incremental capability, building on
    that of the lower level classes. Class TO provides the behavior specified by 1149.1
    from startup when there are multiple on-chip TAPs. Class T1 adds common debug
    functions and features to minimize power consumption. Class T2 adds operating
    modes that maximize scan performance. It also provides an optional hot-connection
    capability to prevent system corruption when a connection is made to a powered
    system. Class T3 supports operation in either a fourwire series or star scan topology.
    Class T4 provides for communication with either a two-pin or four-pin interface.
    The two-pin operation serializes 1149.1 transactions and provides for higher test
    clock rates. Class T5 adds the ability to perform data transfers concurrent with
    scan, supports utilization of functions other than scan, and provides control
    of TAP.7 pins to custom debug technologies in a manner that ensures current and
    future interoperability.
