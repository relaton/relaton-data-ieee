abstract:
- content: Methods used to measure the power factor in low-voltage test circuits are
    covered. Since the power factor measurement for high-capacity test circuits is
    particularly difficult, and different methods may yield different results, the
    methods that are least likely to yield errors are recommended for particular circuit
    conditions. The ratio method is recommended for fast clearing devices that may
    have total interruption times of 0.5 cycle or less. The DC decrement method is
    recommended for circuits with a 30% power factor or less when the device to be
    tested interrupts at a point in time more than 0.5 cycle from the initiation of
    the current. The phase relationship method, using current and voltage waves, is
    recommended for circuits having power factors over 30%.
