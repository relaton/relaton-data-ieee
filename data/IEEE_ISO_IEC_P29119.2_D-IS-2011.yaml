abstract:
- content: This standard covers software testing processes, for use by any organization,
    project or smaller testing activity (e.g. a maintenance testing activity). Testing
    processes (both prescriptive and exploratory), that support all software development
    lifecycle models, including (but not limited to) waterfall, spiral and agile models
    of development are supported by this standard.This part, ISO/IEC 29119-2 Test
    Process, comprises test process descriptions and diagrams that define the software
    testing processes for use by any organization, project, team or individual. It
    is assumed that configuration management of all assets required for testing, including
    testware, is handled by a separate (parallel) process. Therefore, it is not within
    the scope of this standard.
