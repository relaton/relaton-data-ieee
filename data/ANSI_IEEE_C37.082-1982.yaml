abstract:
- content: 'Guidelines for uniform measurement and reporting of sound produced by
    AC power circuit breakers are established. The methods are intended for measuring
    the sound produced by outdoor circuit breakers in a free-field environment. The
    methods may be used indoors or in a restricted field, provided that precautions
    are observed in measurement and interpretation of results. Three types of tests
    are described: design tests, conformance tests, and field tests. The methods are
    intended to provide data that can be used in evaluating the effects of circuit
    breaker sound on human observers, but the evaluation itself is not covered.'
