abstract:
- content: Maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures that can be used to
    optimize the life and performance of permanently installed, vented lead-acid storage
    batteries used for standby power applications are provided. This recommended practice
    also provides guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced. This recommended
    practice is applicable to all stationary applications. However, specific applications,
    such as emergency lighting units and semiportable equipment, may have other appropriate
    practices and are beyond the scope of this recommended practice.
