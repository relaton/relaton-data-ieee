abstract:
- content: Superseded by C62.36-1994. Methods for testing and measuring the characteristics
    of surge protectors used in low voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits
    with voltages less than or equal to 1000 V rms or 1200 V dc are established. The
    surge protectors are designed to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both.
    The surge protectors covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations
    of linear or nonlinear elements. Tests are included for characterizing standby
    performance, surge-limiting capabilities, and surge lifetime. Packaged single
    gas-tube, air-gap, varistor, or avalanche junction surge-protective devices are
    not covered, nor are test methods for low-voltage power circuit applications.
