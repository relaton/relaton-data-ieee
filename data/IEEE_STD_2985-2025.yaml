abstract:
- content: The basic principles, application objectives, functions, performances,
    and test methods for alternating current (ac) standard signal sources with digital
    output is outlined in this guide. Aan approach for preparing a specification for
    ac standard signal sources that provide standardized digital voltage/current output
    signals in the form of a formatted digital output stream is offered. These signals
    are used to simulate the output of an electronic instrument transformer or merging
    unit (MU) when testing intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). The purpose of this
    guide is to serve as a foundational specification, accompanied by informative
    annexes, intended to guide utilities, system integrators, manufacturers, and other
    related entities through defining the overall performance and application objectives
    of ac standard signal sources.
