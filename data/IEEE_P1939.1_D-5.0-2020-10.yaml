abstract:
- content: 'A structure of low-altitude airspace for efficient unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) traffic management is defined in this standard. The standard elaborates
    the structural low altitude based on UAV low-altitude public air routes from five
    parts: grid technology, remote sensing data, communication and networking, route
    planning, operation, and management.'
