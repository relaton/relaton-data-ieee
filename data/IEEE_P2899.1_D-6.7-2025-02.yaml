abstract:
- content: The technical requirements for listening rooms used for speech recognition
    and interaction testing in smart home environments are specified in this standard.
    Requirements for spatial dimensions, site selection, reverberation times, background
    noise levels, sound insulation, etc., are also included. Methods for determining
    key acoustic parameters of the listening room are provided.
