abstract:
- content: The world is witnessing a rapid advance in stereoscopic 3D (S3D), and ultra-high
    definition (UHD) technology. As a result, there is a need for accurate, quality,
    and visual comfort assessment techniques to foster the display device industry,
    as well as signal processing areas. Thorough assessments with respect to the human
    visual system (HVS) for S3D and UHD contents are presented in this standard. Moreover,
    several image and video databases are also publicly provided for any research
    purpose.
