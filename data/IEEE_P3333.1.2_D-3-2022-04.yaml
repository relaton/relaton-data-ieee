abstract:
- content: The world is witnessing a rapid advance in Stereoscopic 3D, and Ultra high
    definition (UHD) technology. As a result, the need for accurate quality and visual
    comfort assessment techniques to foster the display device industry as well as
    signal processing area. In this standard, thorough assessments with respect to
    the human visual system (HVS) for S3D and UHD contents shall be presented. Moreover,
    several image and video databases are also publicly provided for any research
    purpose.
