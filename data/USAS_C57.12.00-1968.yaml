- content: This standard was revised and greatly expanded in 1948, 1949, and 1956.
    The 1956 edition was comprised of a revision and editorial consolidation of the
    preceding standards on distribution, power , and regulating transformers, namely
    American Standard Requirements for Distribution, Power , and Regulating Transformers,
    and Reactors Other Than Current-Limiting Reactors, C57.12-1949, American Standard
    Test Code for Distribution , Power, and Regulating Transformers , C57.22-1948,
    and American Standard Requirements for Transformers-67,000 Volts and Below; 501
    Through 10,000 kva, 3 Phase ; 501 Through 5,000 kva, 1 Phase, C57.12a-1954. In
    addition, in order to eliminate cross-references wherever possible, the consolidation
    contained excerpts from other standards of the C57 family
