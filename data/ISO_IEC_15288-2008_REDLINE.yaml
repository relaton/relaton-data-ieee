abstract:
- content: Revision of ISO/IEC 15288-2004. This International Standard was jointly
    developed by ISO/IEC and IEEE. This International Standard establishes a common
    process framework for describing the life cycle of man-made systems. It defines
    a set of processes and associated terminology for the full life cycle, including
    conception, development, production, utilization, support and retirement. This
    standard also supports the definition, control, assessment, and improvement of
    these processes. These processes can be applied concurrently, iteratively, and
    recursively to a system and its elements throughout the life cycle of a system.
