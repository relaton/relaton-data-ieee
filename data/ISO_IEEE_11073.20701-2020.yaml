abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care
    (PoC) medical device communication, an architecture for service-oriented distributed
    PoC medical devices and medical IT systems is defined. This standard defines a
    binding of the Participant, Discovery, and Communication Model defined in IEEE
    Std 11073-10207&#x2122; to the profile for transport over Web Services defined
    in IEEE Std 11073-20702&#x2122;. Moreover, a binding to Network Time Protocol
    (NTP) and Differentiated Services (DiffServ) is defined for time synchronization
    and transport Quality of Service requirements.
