abstract:
- content: Methods for storing, retrieving, and accessing online laboratories as smart
    and interactive learning objects are defined in this standard. For this purpose,
    the first level of the standard offers any online laboratory (lab) as a service
    (Lab as a Service or LaaS). The standard also defines methods for integrating
    online laboratories as smart learning objects in learning environments and learning
    object repositories.
