abstract:
- content: This standard defines the protocol and data formats for communication devices
    forming a beaconing network that are used to protect low-power, licensed devices
    operating in television broadcast bands from harmful interference generated by
    license-exempt devices, such as Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRAN), intended
    to operate in the same bands. The devices being protected are devices licensed
    as secondary under Title 47, Part 74, Subpart H in the USA and equivalent devices
    in other regulatory domains.
