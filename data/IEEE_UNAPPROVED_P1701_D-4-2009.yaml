abstract:
- content: This standard provides multi-source and plug and play environment for the
    millions of metering devices in the field now and the future using the ANSI Type
    2 optical port interface. It solves the problems associated with single source
    systems and with multi-source systems based upon proprietary communications protocols.
    Electric, Water, and Gas Utilities and corresponding vendors can realize cost
    savings which ultimately shall benefit the client consumers of the Utilities.
