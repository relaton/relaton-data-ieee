abstract:
- content: Additional specific requirements to supplement the criteria and requirements
    of IEEE Std 603 are specified for programmable digital devices. Within the context
    of this standard, the term programmable digital device is any device that relies
    on software instructions or programmable logic to accomplish a function. Examples
    include a computer, a programmable hardware device, or a device with firmware.
    Systems using these devices will also be referred to as digital safety systems
    in this standard. The criteria contained herein, in conjunction with criteria
    in IEEE Std 603, establish minimum functional and design requirements for programmable
    digital devices used as components of a safety system.
