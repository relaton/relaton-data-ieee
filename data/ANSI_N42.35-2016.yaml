abstract:
- content: Minimum performance specifications and testing methods for the evaluation
    of radiation portal monitors, also known as RPMs, are contained in this standard.
    These monitors are large-size permanently mounted-type instruments. These instruments
    are primarily designed for the detection of radioactive materials emitting gamma
    rays and neutrons. The specifications for general, radiological, environmental,
    electromagnetic and mechanical performance are given and the corresponding testing
    methods are described. The documentation to be provided by themanufacturer is
    listed as part of the requirements. A number of informative annexes that provideuseful
    information and guidance in implementing this standard are also contained in thisstandard.
    (The PDF of this standard is available at no cost compliments of the Department
    of Homeland Security Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. http://standards.ieee.org/getN42/download/N42.35-2016.pdf).
