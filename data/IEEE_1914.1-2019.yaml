abstract:
- content: The architecture and requirements for next generation fronthaul networks
    are specified in this standard. NGFI-I is defined as the next generation fronthaul
    network with low layer splits in a baseband station. NGFI-II is defined as the
    next generation fronthaul network with high layer splits in a baseband station.
    The requirements of fronthaul transport nodes in these networks are also specified.
