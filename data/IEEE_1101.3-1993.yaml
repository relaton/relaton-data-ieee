abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Jan 15, 2001. No longer endorsed by
    the IEEE. The mechanical design requirements for conduction-cooled and air-cooled
    modules of the 10SU by 6.375 in (161.9 mm) format are established. The specification
    of dimensions and tolerances is intended to ensure the mechanical intermateability
    of modules within associated subracks. The basic dimension, frames, PWBs, materials,
    assembly, and chassis interface of single-sided and double-sided modules are covered.'
