abstract:
- content: 'Natural and synthetic ester-immersed transformers are handled in this
    guide. Thefollowing is addressed in this guide: a) The theory of combustible gas
    generation in a natural and synthetic ester-filled transformer; b) Interpretation
    of the dissolved gas analysis results; c) Recommended actions based on the interpretation
    of dissolved gas analysis results; d) A bibliography of related literature.'
