abstract:
- content: This test code is concerned with tests on a representative sample of an
    industrial control device or apparatus in order to substantiate conformance of
    that type of device or apparatus with a recognized standard of performance. The
    aim is to insure that the test methods and procedures are capable of giving information
    which is pertinent, significant, and reproducible. No attempt is made to specify
    standards of acceptability for the apparatus, nor to suggest which, if any of
    these tests, should be made.
