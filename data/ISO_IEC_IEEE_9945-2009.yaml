abstract:
- content: 'POSIX.1-2008 is simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1-2008? and The Open Group
    Technical Standard Base Specifications, Issue 7. POSIX.1-2008 defines a standard
    operating system interface and environment, including a command interpreter (or
    "shell"), and common utility programs to support applications portability at the
    source code level. POSIX.1-2008 is intended to be used by both application developers
    and system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an associated
    volume): a) General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this
    standard, including utility conventions and C-language header definitions, are
    included in the Base Definitions volume. b) Definitions for system service functions
    and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming language,
    function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are
    included in the System Interfaces volume. c) Definitions for a standard source
    code-level interface to command interpretation services (a "shell") and common
    utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities
    volume.d) Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document
    structure, which contains historical information concerning the contents of POSIX.1-2008
    and why features were included or discarded by the standard developers, is included
    in the Rationale (Informative) volume. The following areas are outside the scope
    of POSIX.1-2008:1)Graphics interfaces 2)Database management system interfaces
    3)Record I/O considerations 4) Object or binary code portability 5) System configuration
    and resource availability POSIX.1-2008 describes the external characteristics
    and facilities that are of importance to application developers, rather than the
    internal construction techniques employed to achieve these capabilities. Special
    emphasis is placed on those functions and facilities that are needed in a wide
    variety of commercial applications.'
