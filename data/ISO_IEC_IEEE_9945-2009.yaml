abstract:
- content: Revision and Adoption of IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, this standard defines a
    standard operating system interface and environment, including a command interpreter
    (or ‘‘shell’’), and common utility programs to support applications portability
    at the source code level. It is intended to be used by both application developers
    and system implementers.
