abstract:
- content: This Standard defines the storage file formats and RTP pay load formats
    for P1857 Video and P1857.2 Audio. The storage of video and audio not only uses
    the existing capabilities of the ISO Base Media File Format, but also defines
    extensions to support specific features of the P1857 Video codec and P1857.2 Audio
    codec. The target applications and services include but not limited to Internet
    media streaming, IPTV, video conference, video telephony, and video-on-demand.
