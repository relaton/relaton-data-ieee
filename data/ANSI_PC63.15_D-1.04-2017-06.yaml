abstract:
- content: This immunity testing and test instrumentation specifications recommended
    practice complements the procedures for making emission measurements as specified
    in ANSI C63.4 and in ANSI C63.10. These immunity test methods can be of use to
    manufacturers who want to maximize product reliability and reduce customer complaints
    by improving the immunity of their products, beyond that required by applicable
    regulations, or by correcting problems experienced in deployment that are not
    related to regulatory requirements. This recommended practice generally covers
    the frequency range 30 Hz to 10 GHz.
