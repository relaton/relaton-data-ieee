abstract:
- content: The main emphasis of this recommended practice is the engineering design
    of optical fiber communication facilities serving, or connected to, electric supply
    locations. This recommended practice includes methods for providing telecommunication
    facilities serving electric supply locations using optical fiber cables, and their
    related electronic systems, extending across the zone of influence (ZOI).
