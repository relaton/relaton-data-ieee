abstract:
- content: The basic requirements to be met by series connected, solid-state, self-restoring
    overcurrent protectors (OCPs) for the protection of telecommunication equipment
    and lines are presented. This standard should be used for the harmonization of
    existing or future specifications issued by solid-state, self-restoring OCP manufacturers,
    telecommunication equipment manufacturers, administrations, or network operators.
