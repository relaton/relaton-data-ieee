abstract:
- content: The purpose of this recommended practice is to provide a general form for
    the preparation of test procedures and to suggest the points to be considered
    by technical committees in the preparation of specific instructions for the thermal
    evaluation of insulation systems for power equipment. These test procedures involve
    accelerated thermal aging of insulation systems and specify tests which the committees
    deem pertinent, based on conditions of use.
