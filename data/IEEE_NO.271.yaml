abstract:
- content: Redesignated as IEEE C37.34e. The technical requirements for the design,
    fabrication, testing, and installation of a gas-insulated substation (GIS) are
    covered; its intent is advisory. This guide discusses parameters to be supplied
    by the purchaser and technical requirements for the design, fabrication, testing,
    and installation to be furnished by the manufacturer. Environmental conditions,
    general and specific equipment requirements, and a proposal data sheet form are
    included to aid the user.
