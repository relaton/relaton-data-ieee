abstract:
- content: This guide covers identification of the key parameters that can be monitored
    for obtaining an indication of the condition of liquid-immersed transformers.
    It also covers risk/benefit analysis, sensor application, and monitoring systems
    application. This guide does not cover interpretation of monitoring results.
