abstract:
- content: The Verilog(R) Hardware Description Language (HDL) is defined in this standard.
    Verilog HDL is a formal notation intended for use in all phases of the creation
    of electronic systems. Because it is both machine readable and human readable,
    it supports the development, verification, synthesis, and testing of hardware
    designs; the communication of hardware design data; and the maintenance, modification,
    and procurement of hardware. The primary audiences for this standard are the implementors
    of tools supporting the language and advanced users of the language.
