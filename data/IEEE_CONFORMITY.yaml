abstract:
- content: This white paper examines the biggest interoperability and cybersecurity
    issues facing the IoT-enabled sensors and makes recommendations to remedy them.
    In addition, it proposes a plan to enable the sensor market to take advantage
    of IoT capabilities. A draft version of this white paper served as supporting
    material for the IEEE Sensors Roundtable meeting of industry leaders that was
    held in Austin, Texas, on September 14-15, 2022. This final version has been updated
    with the recommendations from the Roundtable meeting.
