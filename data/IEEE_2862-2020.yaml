abstract:
- content: The aim of this recommended practice is to establish a protocol for the
    measurement of partial discharges using ac voltages and VHF/UHF electromagnetic
    sensors, for quality control during routine tests on factory and pre-molded joints
    of high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) extruded cable systems having voltage ratings
    up to 800 kV. The various steps of the protocol for the measurement of partial
    discharges in such cables are carefully described. Details are given about the
    procedure for a sensor performance check, test setup preparation, and success
    criteria. The ultimate goal of this recommended practice is not verifying the
    compliance with any maximum acceptable limit of partial discharge amplitude, but
    rather focusing on the whole phenomenon of partial discharges, in order to assess
    whether critical partial discharges are present in the tested object (either a
    factory joint or a pre-molded joint of a HVDC extruded cable system). &#x201C;Critical
    partial discharge&#x201D; is used here to mean a discharge within the insulation
    of the object under test, excluding all external discharges that can be present
    during the ac voltage test, (e.g., corona discharges due to HV electrodes, conducting
    leads related to the test setup).
