abstract:
- content: Practical instrumentation methods are presented for measuring the ac characteristics
    of large, extended or interconnected grounding systems. Measurements of impedance
    to remote earth, step and touch potentials, and current distributions are covered
    for grounding systems ranging in complexity from small grids (less than 900m 2),
    with only a few connected overhead or direct burial bare concentric (2) neutrals,
    to large grids (greater than 20 000m 2), with many connected neutrals, overhead
    ground wires (sky wires), counterpoises, grid tie conductors, cable shields, and
    metallic pipes. This standard addresses measurement safety; earth-return mutual
    errors; low-current measurements; power-system staged faults; communication and
    control cable transfer impedance; current distribution (current splits) in the
    grounding system; step, touch, mesh, and profile measurements; the foot-equivalent
    electrode earth resistance; and instrumentation characteristics and limitations.
