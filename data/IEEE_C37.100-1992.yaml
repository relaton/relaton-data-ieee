abstract:
- content: Terms that encompass the products within the scope of the C37 project are
    defined. These include power switchgear for switching, interrupting, metering,
    protection, and regulating purposes as used primarily in connection with generation,
    transmission, distribution, and conversion of electric power. The definitions
    do not purport to embrace other meanings that the terms may properly have when
    used in connection with other subjects.
