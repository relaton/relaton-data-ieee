abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std C57.12.37-2006 A basis for the electronic reporting
    of transformer test data on liquid immersed distribu-tion transformers as defined
    in the ANSI C57.12.2X standards series is provided. The specific setof test data
    to be reported and the format in which it is to be reported is detailed along
    with an ex-tended set of data as an option for the user.
