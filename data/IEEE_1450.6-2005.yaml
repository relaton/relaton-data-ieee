abstract:
- content: The Core Test Language (CTL) is a language created for a System-on-Chip
    flow (or SoC flow), where a design created by one group is reused as a sub-design
    of a design created by another group. In an SoC flow, the smaller design embedded
    in the larger design is commonly called a core and the larger design is commonly
    called the SoC. The core is a design provided by a core provider, and the task
    of incorporating the sub-design into the SoC is called Core System Integration.
