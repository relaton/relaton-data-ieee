abstract:
- content: The purpose of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 Software Testing standards is to
    define an internationally-agreed set of standards for software testing that can
    be used by any organization when performing any form of software testing. ISO/IEC/IEEE
    29119-5 defines Keyword-Driven Testing, which is an approach to describing test
    cases in a modular way. This standard explains the main concepts and attributes
    of Keyword-Driven Testing and is applicable to all those who want to create keyword-driven
    test specifications, create corresponding frameworks, or build test automation
    based on keywords. This standard defines requirements on frameworks for Keyword-Driven
    Testing to enable test engineers to share their test artefacts, such as test cases,
    test data, keywords, or complete test specifications. It also defines minimum
    requirements for tools supporting Keyword-Driven Testing and defines requirements
    on a common data exchange format to ensure that tools from different vendors can
    exchange their data (e.g. test cases, test data and test results).
