abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Dec 09, 1997. No longer endorsed by
    the IEEE. Revision of IEEE Std 1017-1985 Procedures and test-voltage values for
    acceptance and maintenance testing of electrical submersible pump (ESP) cable
    systems are presented. This recommended practice applies to cable systems rated
    3000 V and 5000 V and is intended only for this special-purpose cable. The intent
    is to provide uniform test procedures an guidelines for evaluation of the test
    results.'
