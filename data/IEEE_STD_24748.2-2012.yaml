abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 24748-2:2011 is adopted by this standard. ISO/IEC TR 24748-2:2011
    is a guide for the application of ISO/IEC 15288:2008. It addresses system, life
    cycle, process, organizational, project, and adaptation concepts, principally
    through reference to ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 and ISO/IEC 15288:2008. It then gives
    guidance on applying ISO/IEC 15288:2008 from the aspects of strategy, planning,
    application in organizations, and application on projects. ISO/IEC TR 24748-2:2011
    is intentionally aligned with both ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 and ISO/IEC TR 24748-3 (Guide
    to the application of ISO/IEC 12207) in its terminology, structure and content.
