abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice provides information and guidance for characterizing
    radiated levels of electromagnetic (EM) noise or interference that may be present
    in various environments between 10 kHz and 40 GHz. It provides methods that may
    be used to plan for and execute the electromagnetic environment characterization
    of a particular environment or location. Characterizing the electromagnetic environment
    is traditionally referred to as a site survey. A site survey can be applicable
    to congested metropolitan environments, industrial settings, commercial buildings,
    open fields, remote geographical locations, in and around ships, aircraft, and
    vehicles, etc.
