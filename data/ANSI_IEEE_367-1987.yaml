abstract:
- content: Guidance is provided for the calculation of interfering voltages and their
    appropriate reduction from worst-case values for use in wire-line telecommunication
    protection design. Information is also included for the determination of the fault
    current and earth-return current levels; their probability, waveform, and duration;
    and the impedance to remote earthing points used in these ground potential rise
    (GPR) and longitudinally induced voltage calculations. The zone of influence of
    the power station GPR; the calculation of the inducing currents; the mutual impedance
    between power and wire-line telecommunication facilities and shield factors; and
    the channel time requirements for wire-line telecommunication facilities where
    noninterruptible channels are required for protective relaying and other purposes
    are covered.
