abstract:
- content: The communication protocol described by IEEE Std 1149.1-2001 (Standard
    Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture) has been adopted by this standard
    for providing standardized programming access and methodology for programmable
    integrated circuit devices. Devices that implement this standard will first be
    compliant with IEEE Std 1149.1-2001, which is used for testing purposes. A device,
    or set of devices, implementing this standard can be programmed (written), read
    back, erased, and verified, singly or concurrently, with a standardized set of
    resources. Sample implementation and application details (which are not part of
    this standard) are included for illustrative purposes.
