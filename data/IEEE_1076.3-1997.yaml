abstract:
- content: The current interpretation of common logic values and the association of
    numeric values to specific VHDL array types is described. This standard provides
    semantic for the VHDL synthesis domain, and enables formal verification and simulation
    acceleration in the VHDL based design. The standard interpretations are provided
    for values of standard logic types defined by IEEE Std 1164-1993, and of the BIT
    and BOOLEAN types defined in IEEE Std 1076-1993. The numeric types SIGNED and
    UNSIGNED and their associated operators define integer and natural number arithmetic
    for arrays of common logic values. Twos complement and binary encoding techniques
    are used. The numeric semantic is conveyed by two VHDL packages. This standard
    also contains any allowable modifications.
