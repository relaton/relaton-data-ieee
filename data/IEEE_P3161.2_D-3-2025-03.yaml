abstract:
- content: The aspects of reference architecture, components, interfaces, and functional
    requirements of the end subsystem of digital retina system (DRS) are specified
    in this standard to support collaborative computing with model stream, video stream,
    and feature stream. The functions of the end subsystem are software-definable,
    and the models are updatable, which can flexibly adapt to the changes of scenes.
