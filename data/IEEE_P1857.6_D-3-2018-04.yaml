abstract:
- content: 'Tools for description of visual content, including still images and videos,
    are specified in this standard. Visual content description consists of visual
    features, text labels, and device information. This standard is divided into two
    profiles: basic profile and surveillance profile. The basic profile specifies
    basic visual descriptors that apply to general purpose. The surveillance profile
    is a superset of the basic profile and includes all the descriptions specified
    in the basic profile as well as special descriptors for surveillance purpose.'
