abstract:
- content: 'Conformance tests and requirements for the coating integrity of pole-mounted
    enclosures for application in coastal environments containing apparatus energized
    in excess of 600 V, typically located out of reach of the general public, including,
    but not limited to, the following types of equipment enclosures: pole-mounted
    distribution transformers, pole-mounted switches, pole-mounted regulators, pole-mounted
    metering equipment, pole-mounted reclosers, and pole-mounted switchgear, are discussed.'
