abstract:
- content: Recommended practices for the design of dc power systems for stationary
    applications is provided by this document. The components of the dc power system
    addressed by this document include lead-acid and nickel-cadmium storage batteries,
    static battery chargers, and distribution equipment. Guidance in selecting the
    quantity and types of equipment, the equipment ratings, interconnections, instrumentation
    and protection is also provided. This recommendation is applicable for power generation,
    substation, and telecommunication applications.
