abstract:
- content: These Marine Recommendations have been drawn up to serve as a guide for
    the equipment of merchant vessels with an electric plant system and electric apparatus
    for lighting, signaling, communication, power, and propulsion. They indicate what
    is considered good engineering practice with reference to safety of the personnel
    and of the ship itself as well as reliability and durability of the apparatus;
    it is not intended, however, that improvements, which may be developed from time
    to time, should be excluded.
