abstract:
- content: U.S. consensus standard methods, instrumentation, and facilities for measurement
    of radio-frequency (RF) emissions and signals emitted from wireless power transfer
    equipment in the frequency range from 9 kHz to 40 GHz are specified. This standard
    does not include generic nor product-specific emission limits. Where possible,
    the specifications herein are harmonized with other national and international
    standards used for similar purposes.
