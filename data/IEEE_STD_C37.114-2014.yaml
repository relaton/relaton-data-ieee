abstract:
- content: 'Electrical faults on transmission and distribution lines are detected
    and isolated by system protective devices. Once the fault has been cleared, outage
    times can be reduced if the location of the fault can be determined more quickly.
    The techniques and application considerations for determining the location of
    a fault on ac transmission and distribution lines are outlined in this guide.
    Traditional approaches and the primary measurement techniques used in modern devices
    are reviewed: one- and two-terminal impedance-based methods and traveling-wave
    methods. Application considerations include: two- and three-terminal lines, series-compensated
    lines, parallel lines, untransposed lines, underground cables, fault resistance
    effects, and other power system conditions, including those unique to distribution
    systems.'
