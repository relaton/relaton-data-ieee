abstract:
- content: 'A stationary battery can be operated in two basic modes: 1) standby (or
    float) and 2) cycling. Many standards developed for standby stationary applications
    do not apply to cycling stationary applications, and vice versa. The purpose of
    this guide is to differentiate between these two applications and increase awareness
    of why and how their different operation and maintenance practices should be managed.
    The guide is primarily informational and is not intended to provide specific recommendations
    for battery management in cycling applications.'
