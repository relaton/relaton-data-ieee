abstract:
- content: This new dry-type transformer standard describes ventilated dry-type transformers
    with self-cooled kilovolt-ampere ratings 501 to 7500 and high voltages 601 to
    34 500 volts; forced-air-cooled ratings for certain sizes are listed in Part II.
    (American National Standards Committee on Specialty Transformers, C89, has responsibility
    for transformers with high voltages 600 volts and below.) This standard is part
    of a new series of dry-type standards that also includes American National Standard
    General Requirements for Dry-Type Distribution and Power Transformers, ANSI/IEEE
    C57.12.01-1979; American National Standard Test Code for Dry-Type Distribution
    and Power Transformers, ANSI/ IEE C57.12.91-1979; American National Standard Requirements
    for Ventilated Dry-Type Distribution Transformers, 1 to 500 kVA, Single-Phase,
    and 15 to 500 kVA, Three-Phase, with High-Voltage 601 to 34 500 Volts, Low-Voltage
    120 to 600 Volts, ANSI C57.12.50-1981; and American National Standard Requirements
    for Sealed Dry-Type Power Transformers, 501 kVA and Larger, Three-Phase, with
    High-Voltage 601 to 34 500 Volts, Low-Voltage 208Y/120 to 4160 Volts, ANSI C57.12.52-1981
