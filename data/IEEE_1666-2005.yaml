abstract:
- content: SystemC(R) is defined in this standard. SystemC(R) is an ANSI standard
    C++ class library for system and hardware design for use by designers and architects
    who need to address complex systems that are a hybrid between hardware and software.
    This standard provides a precise and complete definition of the SystemC(R) class
    library so that a SystemC(R) implementation can be developed with reference to
    this standard alone. The primary audiences for this standard are the implementers
    of the SystemC(R) library, the implementers of tools supporting the class library,
    and users of the class library. The IEEE 1666&#8482; program grants public access
    to view and download the current individual IEEE standard at no charge in PDF
    format thanks to the Open System C Initiative. Visit http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/index.html
    for details.
