abstract:
- content: Concepts of power bus protection are discussed in this guide. Consideration
    is given to availability and location of breakers, current transformers, and disconnectors
    as well as bus-switching scenarios, and their impact on the selection and application
    of bus protection. A number of bus protection schemes are presented; their adequacy,
    complexity, strengths, and limitations with respect to a variety of bus arrangements
    are discussed; specific application guidelines are provided. Breaker failure protection
    is discussed as pertaining to bus protection. Means of securing bus protection
    schemes against corrupted relay input signals are also included.
