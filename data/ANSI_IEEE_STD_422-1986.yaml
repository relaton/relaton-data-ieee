abstract:
- content: This document has been developed as a guide for the design and installation
    of wire and cable systems in generating stations with the objective of minimizing
    failures and their consequences. It applies to both nuclear and nonnuclear electric
    power generating stations. It covers cable performance, size and voltage rating,
    electrical segregation, separation of redundant systems, shielding and shield
    grounding. Cable penetration fire stops, fire detection and extinguishing systems,
    cable installation, acceptance tests and raceways are also covered.<<ETX>>
