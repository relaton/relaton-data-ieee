abstract:
- content: This standard, in conjunction with IEEE Std 1386-2001, IEEE Standard for
    a CommonMezzanine Card (CMC) Family, defines the physical and environmental layers
    of a PCI mezzaninecard (PMC) family to be usable on (but not limited to) single
    slot VME, VME64 and VME64x boards,CompactPCI boards, Multibus I and Multibus II
    boards, desktop computers, portable computers,servers, and similar types of applications.
    The electrical and logical layers are based on the PCIspecification from the PCI
    Special Interest Group. The PCI mezzanine cards allow for a variety ofoptional
    function expansions for the host system. I/O functionality from the PMC may be
    eitherthrough the mezzanine front panel, or via the backplane by routing the I/O
    signals through themezzanine connector to the host.
