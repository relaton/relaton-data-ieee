abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of the communication
    between personal body composition analyzing devices and managers (e.g., cell phones,
    personal computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner that
    enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate portions of existing
    standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology and IEEE 11073-20601&#x2122; information
    models. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in
    telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of
    interoperability. This standard defines a common core of communication functionality
    for personal telehealth body composition analyzer devices. In this context, body
    composition analyzer devices are being used broadly to cover body composition
    analyzer devices that measure body impedances, and compute the various body components
    including body fat from the impedance.
