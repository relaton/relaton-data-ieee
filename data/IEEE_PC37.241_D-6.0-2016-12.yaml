abstract:
- content: 'Guidance is offered on the application and use of optical voltage and
    current sensor systems for protective relaying, covering the selection, installation,
    testing, and operation of sensors. Information is provided on optical voltage
    and current-sensing technologies, and a number of performance parameters including:
    accuracy, bandwidth, noise, stability, and impact of temperature and vibration.
    Also covered are interface requirements of optical sensor systems, a number of
    their applications, relevant installation and commissioning, testing, reliability,
    and redundancy matters, as well as a comprehensive treatment of the relevant industry
    standards.'
