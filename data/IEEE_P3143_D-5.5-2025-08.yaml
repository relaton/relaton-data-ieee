abstract:
- content: The system structure, usage conditions, basic functions, performance requirements,
    and RAMS requirements of the electric traction system for short primary maglev
    vehicles are described in this standard. Additionally, the test rules and methods
    are provided. It is intended to guide and standardize the design, inspection,
    evaluation, and acceptance processes of the electric traction system for short
    primary maglev vehicles.
