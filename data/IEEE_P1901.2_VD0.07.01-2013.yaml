abstract:
- content: This contribution represents the coexistence-related text from IEEE P1901.2
    working draft version D0.07.01. It includes clause 10 and convenient front matter.
    Developed by IEEE P1901.2, this is a worldwide standard for coexistence mechnisms
    that can be used for narrowband power line communications via ac, dc, and non-energized
    electric power lines using frequencies below 500 kHz. The field-of-use includes
    Smart Grid applications. Coexistence mechanisms that can be used by other PLC
    technologies operating below 500 kHz are also included. These coexistence mechanisms
    may be used separately from the rest of the IEEE P1901.2TM.
