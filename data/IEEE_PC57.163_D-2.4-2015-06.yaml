abstract:
- content: This guide describes the effects of Geomagnetic Disturbances (GMD) on power
    transformers when there is the presence of Geomagnetically Induced Current (GIC)
    in a power transformer. It establishes specification parameters and performance
    characteristics for power transformers to help minimize the risk and impact when
    GIC is present in the power system. The intent is to provide background that can
    help evaluate the effect of GIC on a power transformer design and its GIC capability.
    This includes the evaluation techniques to determine the 6 performance characteristics
    while under the influence of GIC.
