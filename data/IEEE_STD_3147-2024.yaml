abstract:
- content: Techniques for the variant design of electronics production lines are provided
    in this recommended practice. The techniques covered include requirements documentation,
    production line remodeling, variant design procedures, iterative design patterns,
    and results evaluation. The requirements documentation is to capture the variation
    requirement. The production line remodeling is to remodel the elements together
    with their correlations between variation features and parameters. The variant
    design procedures and iterative design patterns detail the variation mechanism
    and typical iteration patterns, respectively, based on the parameter correlation
    remodeling. The results evaluation is to evaluate the performance of the designed
    production line.
