abstract:
- content: A test procedure is established to provide a uniform method for investigating
    the effect of operating temperature on the life expectancy of liquid-immersed
    transformers. The test procedures are intended to provide data for the selection
    of a limiting hottest-spot temperature for rating purposes, provide data which
    may serve as the basis for a guide for loading, and permit the comparative evaluation
    of a proposed insulation system with reference to a system that has proven to
    be acceptable in service.
