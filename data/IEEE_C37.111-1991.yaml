abstract:
- content: A common format for the data files and exchange medium needed for the interchange
    of various types of fault, test, or simulation data is defined. Sources of transient
    data are described, and the case of diskettes as an exchange medium is recommended.
    Issues of sampling rates, filters, and sample rate conversions for transient data
    being exchanged are discussed. Files for data exchange are specified, as is the
    organization of the data. A sample file is given.
