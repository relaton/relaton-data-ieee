abstract:
- content: Two alternate physical layers (PHYs), TASK and RS-GFSK, are specified in
    this amendment in addition to the PHYs of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015. The amendment
    also defines the medium access control (MAC) modifications needed to support the
    implementation of the TASK and RS-GFSK PHYs. These alternate PHYs enable low-cost,
    ultra-low power consumption, as well as extended battery life, in various frequency
    bands and geographical regions under multiple regulatory domains.
