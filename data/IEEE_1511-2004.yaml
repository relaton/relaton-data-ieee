abstract:
- content: This guide will discuss the importance of failure analysis on cable, joints,
    and terminations used in power systems rated 5kV through 46kV. Users should review
    the definitions and technical papers that are listed in the References and in
    the Bibliography to gain an understanding of failure analysis issues. Why a cable,
    joint, or termination fails is an important part of understanding trends and planning
    for improvements in system reliability.
