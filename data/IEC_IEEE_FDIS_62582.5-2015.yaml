abstract:
- content: This part of IEC/IEEE 62582 contains methods for monitoring the attenuation
    condition of optical fibres and cables in instrumentation and control systems
    using optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) measurements in the detail necessary
    to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. It includes the requirements
    for the measurement system and conditions, and the reporting of the measurement
    results. The different parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 are measurement standards, primarily
    for use in the management of ageing in initial qualification and after installation.
    IEC/IEEE 62582-1 includes requirements for the application of the other parts
    of IEC/IEEE 62582 and some elements which are common to all methods. Information
    on the role of condition monitoring in qualification of equipment important to
    safety is found in IEEE Std 323. Detailed descriptions of methods for OTDR measurement
    of the quality and functionality of fibre optic cables are given in IEC 61280-4-1
    for multimode attenuation and in IEC 61280-4-2 for single-mode attenuation.
