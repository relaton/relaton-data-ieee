abstract:
- content: This standard sets forth the requirements for installation, inspection,
    and testing of power, instrumentation, and control equipment and systems during
    the construction phase of a nuclear facility. These requirements also cover modifications
    and those operating phase activities that are comparable in nature and extent
    to related initial construction activities of the facility. The intent of this
    standard is to establish requirements for safety systems equipment. (Safety systems
    equipment defined in IEEE Std 603-1980.1) However, this standard may also be applied
    to non-safety systems equipment.
