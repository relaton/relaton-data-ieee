abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Jan 10, 2002. No longer endorsed by
    the IEEE. A set of standard procedures for determining and verifying the total
    losses of a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) converter station is recommended.
    The procedures are applicable to all parts of the converter station and cover
    standby, partial load, and full load losses and methods of calculation and measurement.
    All line commutated converter stations used for power exchange in utility systems
    are covered. Loss determination procedures for synchronous compensators or static
    var compensators are not included.'
