abstract:
- content: 'Covered in this standard are the requirements for line hardware used in
    overhead lines, including clevis and eye fittings, Y-clevis fittings, socket fittings,
    ball fittings, chain links, shackles, triangular and rectangular yoke plates,
    suspension clamps, strain clamps, straight-line deadend clamps, and shoulder live-line
    extension links. (Note: IEEE C135.100-2024 supersedes C135.61-1997, C135.62-2009,
    C135.63-1998 and C135.64-2012.)'
