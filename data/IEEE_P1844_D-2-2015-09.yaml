abstract:
- content: Standardization of circuit integrity cable testing is beneficial to cable
    manufactures, distributors, and users. Uniform procedures, consistent, repeatable
    results, and measureable test acceptance criteria are required to allow comparisons
    among competing products and to allow selection of the correct product for the
    application. In nuclear power facilities, electrical cables are relied upon to
    safely control the plant systems. Circuit integrity cables serve as fire-resistive
    protection for electrical circuits. Circuit integrity cables with a 1-hour or
    3-hour ratings are expected to protect the electrical circuit from the effects
    of severe fire conditions to allow for achieving and maintaining safe shutdown
    conditions and suppression activities.
