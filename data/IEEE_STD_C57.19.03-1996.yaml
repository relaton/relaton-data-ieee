abstract:
- content: This standard applies to outdoor and indoor power apparatus DC bushings
    of condenser type that have basic impulse insulation levels of 110 kV and above
    for use as components of oil-filled converter transformers and smoothing reactors,
    as well as air-to-air DC bushings. This IEEE standard defines the special terms
    used, service conditions, rating, general requirements, electrical insulation
    characteristics, and test procedure for the bushings for DC application.
