abstract:
- content: When machine parameters are expressed in a properly selected per-unit system,
    the parameters of a wide range of machine sizes fall into relatively narrow ranges
    even though the actual values of these same parameters may vary over extremely
    wide ranges. The per-unit system thereby makes possible an easy comparison between
    different machines, essentially independent of size, without the use of conversion
    factors, and facilitates the identification of gross calculation errors. The proper
    selection of base values is fundamental to the usefulness of a per-unit system.
    Although per-unit quantities have been used for many years by designers of rotating
    machinery, the base quantities were not standardized, and it was necessary to
    define them in each publication. A working group of the Rotating Machinery Committee
    was created to propose a set of standard definitions. In 1961, a proposed standard
    (AIEE No. 86) was published for trial use. A critical review of that proposed
    standard has resulted in this present standard.
