abstract:
- content: Certain mechanical requirements relating to tank strength as well as static
    and dynamic tank pressure mitigation for liquid-immersed distribution transformers
    are covered in this standard. The electrical and mechanical requirements of any
    accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer are not covered in
    this standard. It is intended to define the mechanical performance requirements
    to prevent permanent tank deformation or rupture of distribution transformers
    covered under this standard. These requirements will provide a more standard design
    of transformer tank and associated components related with both static and dynamic
    pressure coordination.
