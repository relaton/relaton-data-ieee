abstract:
- content: This guide covers the application of metal-oxide surge arresters to safeguard
    electric power equipment, with a nominal operating voltage 1000 V and above, against
    the hazards of abnormally high voltage surges of various origins. This guide provides
    information on the characteristics of metal-oxide surge arresters, and the protection
    of substation equipment, distribution systems, overhead lines, and large electrical
    machines.
