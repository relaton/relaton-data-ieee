abstract:
- content: The stray current corrosion issues associated with dc rail transit systems
    are well documented. However, there is a need for a concise guide document that
    can be used by transit agencies as a framework for initially designing systems
    and for the ongoing maintenance of those systems. This guide will assist transit
    agencies in the establishment of key processes as well as design and maintenance
    requirements for the mitigation of stray current effects on new and existing dc
    rail transit systems. The Guide will serve as a knowledge base for transit engineering
    personnel to reduce stray current problems and to take appropriate proactive measures.
