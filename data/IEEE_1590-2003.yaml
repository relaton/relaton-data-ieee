abstract:
- content: The main emphasis of this recommended practice is the engineering design
    of optical fiber communication facilities serving, or connected to, electrical
    supply locations. This document includes methods for providing telecommunication
    facilities serving electrical supply locations using optical fiber cables extending
    across the zone of influence (ZOI)
