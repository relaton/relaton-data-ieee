abstract:
- content: This document provides requirements and guidance to information developers
    and related roles on how to adapt the processes described in the ISO/IEC/IEEE
    265NN family of International Standards to develop quality information for users.
    This document is independent of the agile development methods and tools that are
    used to produce the software. This document gives an overview of agile methodologies
    although it neither encourages nor discourages the use of any particular agile
    methodology. Therefore, this document uses generic agile terminology as much as
    possible.
