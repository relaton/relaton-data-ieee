abstract:
- content: Draft D12 This recommended practice prescribes the methods for assessing
    and predicting the reliability of software, based on a life cycle approach to
    software reliability engineering. It provides information necessary for the application
    of software reliability measurement to a project, lays a foundation for building
    consistent methods, and establishes the basic principle for collecting the data
    needed to assess and predict the reliability of software. The document prescribes
    how any user can participate in on going software reliability assessments and
    predictions.
