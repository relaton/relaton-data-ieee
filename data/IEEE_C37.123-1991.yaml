abstract:
- content: IEEE C37.123-1991 covers the technical requirements for the design, fabrication,
    testing, and installation of a gas-insulated substation (GIS). The guide looks
    at parameters to be supplied by the purchaser and technical requirements for the
    design, fabrication, testing, and installation to be furnished by the manufacturer.
    Environmental conditions, general and specific equipment requirements, and a proposal
    data sheet form are included to aid the user.
