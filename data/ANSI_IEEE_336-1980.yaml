abstract:
- content: This standard sets forth the minimum requirements for installation, inspection
    and testing of Class 1E power, instrumentation and control equipment and systems
    during the construction phase of a nuclear power generating station. These requirements
    also cover modifications and those activities occurring during the operating phase
    that are comparable in nature and extent to related activities occurring during
    the initial construction of the station. All references to construction activities
    in this standard shall refer to this scope which includes operational modifications.
