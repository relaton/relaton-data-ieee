abstract:
- content: 'The Portable Applications Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society
    carried out a series of analyses of various problems encountered by users of IEEE
    Std 1003.2-1992, IEEE Standard for Information Technology-Portable Operating System
    Interface (POSIX)-Part 2: Shell and Utilities. The results of its deliberations
    are presented in this document. The intent is to give the POSIX community reasonable
    ways of interpreting unclear portions of the standard.'
