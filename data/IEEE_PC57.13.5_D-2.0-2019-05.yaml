abstract:
- content: Single-phase instrument transformers of a nominal system voltage of 115
    kV and above with capacitive insulation system for line-to-ground connection and
    for both indoor and outdoor application are discussed in this standard. This standard
    is intended for use as a supplement to IEEE Std C57.13-2016 and as a basis for
    performance and safety of equipment. Test sequences, criteria, methods, and documentation
    for the test are also described.
