abstract:
- content: The High Level Architecture (HLA) has been developed to provide a common
    architecture for distributed modeling and simulation. The HLA defines an integrated
    approach that provides a common framework for the interconnection of interacting
    simulations. This standard, describing the framework and rules of the High Level
    Architecture (HLA), is the capstone document for a family of related HLA standards.
    It defines the HLA, its components, and the rules that outline the responsibilities
    of HLA federates and federations to ensure a consistent implementation. Simulations
    are abstractions of the real world, and no one simulation can solve all of the
    functional needs for the modeling and simulation community. It is anticipated
    that technology advances will allow for new and different modeling and simulation
    (M&amp;S) implementations within the framework of the HLA. The standards contained
    in this architecture are interrelated and need to be considered as a product set
    when changes are made. They each have value independently.
