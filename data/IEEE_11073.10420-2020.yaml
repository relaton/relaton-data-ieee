abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of the communication between personal body
    composition analyzer agents and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal computers,
    personal health appliances, set-top boxes) is established by this standard in
    a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate
    portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information
    models, application profile standards, and transport standards. It specifies the
    use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments
    to restrict optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This
    standard defines a common core of communication functionality for personal telehealth
    body composition analyzers.In this context, the phrase &#x201C;body composition
    analyzer&#x201D; is used broadly to cover analyzing devices that measure body
    impedances and compute the various body components including body fat from the
    impedance.
