abstract:
- content: Adoption of IEEE Std 1076-2008. VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL)
    is defined. VHDL is a formal notation intended for use in all phases of the creation
    of electronic systems. Because it is both machine readable and human readable,
    it supports the development, verification, synthesis, and testing of hardware
    designs; the communication of hardware design data; and the maintenance, modification,
    and procurement of hardware. Its primary audiences are the implementors of tools
    supporting the language and the advanced users of the language. (Superseded by
    IEEE C95.1-2019)
