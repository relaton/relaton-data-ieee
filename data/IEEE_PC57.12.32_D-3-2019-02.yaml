abstract:
- content: 'Design and production tests and requirements for the integrity of submersible
    electrical equipment intended for installation in submerged or partially submerged
    environments are covered in this standard. These enclosures contain energized
    electrical apparatus, typically not accessible to the general public including,
    but not limited to, the following types of equipment: submersible distribution
    transformers; submersible network transformers; submersible network protectors;
    submersible switchgear; submersible capacitors or inductors; submersible junction
    enclosures; submersible metering equipment; and submersible control boxes.'
