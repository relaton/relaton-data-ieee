abstract:
- content: This guide suggests surge arrester installation methods at distribution
    cable terminal poles in order to minimize the total impressed transient voltage
    on medium-voltage distribution cables. Grounding electrode techniques, pole ground
    values, and system ground grid values are not addressed or considered in this
    document.
