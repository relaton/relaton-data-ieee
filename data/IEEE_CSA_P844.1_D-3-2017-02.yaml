abstract:
- content: General requirements, testing, markings, and documentation for skin effect
    trace heating systems for pipelines, vessels, equipment, and structures intended
    for use in general industrial applications are provided in this standard. This
    standard provides requirements when utilizing skin effect trace heating systems
    in ordinary as well as hazardous areas that have potentially explosive atmospheres.
