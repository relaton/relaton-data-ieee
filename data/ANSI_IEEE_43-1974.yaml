abstract:
- content: Superseded by 43-2000. Insulation resistance characteristics of rotating-machine
    windings and the manner in which these characteristics may serve to indicate the
    condition of the winding are described. The recommended procedure for the measurement
    of insulation resistance of windings of rotating machines rated 1 hp, 1 kW or
    greater is presented. The recommended minimum value of insulation resistance of
    alternating-current and direct-current rotating-machine windings is given. Synchronous
    machines, induction machines, direct-current machines, and synchronous converters
    are covered, as well as armature windings and field windings. Fractional-horsepower
    machines are not included.
