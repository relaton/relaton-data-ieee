abstract:
- content: Ratings, construction, and testing of dead-front control switchboards containing,
    but not limited to, devices such as switches, control devices, instrumentation,
    metering, monitoring, protective and auxiliary relays, and regulating devices
    and accessories are covered. Switchboards for the control and protection of apparatus
    used for or associated with power generation, conversion, transmission, and distribution
    are included, but the standard is not limited to these. Industrial controls, communication
    equipment, switchboards for use on board ships, Class 1E switchboards for use
    in nuclear generating stations, and human factors are not considered.
