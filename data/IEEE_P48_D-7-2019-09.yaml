abstract:
- content: This standard provides test procedures and requirements for all indoor
    and outdoor cable terminations used on alternating-current shielded cables having
    laminated insulation rated 2.5 kV through 765 kV and extruded insulation rated
    2.5 kV through 500 kV, except separable insulated connectors, which are covered
    by IEEE Std 386-2016 [B18]. Cable terminations and component parts shall be capable
    of withstanding the tests specified in this standard
