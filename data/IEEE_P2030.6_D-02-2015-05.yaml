abstract:
- content: This draft guide proposed a framework for monitoring the effects and evaluating
    comprehensive benefits of demand response programs. From perspectives of ex ante
    and ex post evaluation, the draft guide introduces the contents including the
    evaluation processes on demand response effects with its comprehensive benefits,
    and implemented calculation methods in detail. This guide could be applied in
    various electricity market structures to provide utilities the references for
    the planning, design, implementation and post-evaluation of demand response programs.
