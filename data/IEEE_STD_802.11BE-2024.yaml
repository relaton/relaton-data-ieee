abstract:
- content: This amendment defines standardized modifications to both the IEEE Std
    802.11 physical layers (PHY) and the Medium Access Control Layer (MAC) that enable
    at least one mode of operation capable of supporting a maximum throughput of at
    least 30 Gbit/s, as measured at the MAC data service access point (SAP), with
    carrier frequency operation between 1 and 7.250 GHz while ensuring backward compatibility
    and coexistence with legacy IEEE Std 802.11 compliant devices operating in the
    2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands. This amendment defines at least one mode of operation
    capable of improved worst case latency and jitter.
