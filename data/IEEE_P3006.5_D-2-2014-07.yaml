abstract:
- content: This recommended practice describes how to use probability methods for
    conducting a reliability analysis of industrial and commercial power systems.
    It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited
    experience in the area of reliability. It can also be an aid to all engineers
    responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.
