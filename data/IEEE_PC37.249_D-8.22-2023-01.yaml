abstract:
- content: Security categorization is the first step in a security risk management
    framework because of its impact on all other steps, from the selection of security
    controls to apply based on the assessment to the level of effort required to assess
    the effectiveness of the security controls put in place. Information (data) at
    rest and information systems are covered by security categorization. The approach
    used in this guide applies only to data at rest. Types of information and information
    systems are considered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    Special Publication (SP) 800-60 Vol. 1, Rev. 1 [B16]. Security categories--based
    on the magnitude of harm expected to result from compromises rather than on the
    results of an assessment that includes an attempt to determine the probability
    of compromise--are established by Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
    199 [B1]. These standards are aligned by the approach in this guide.
