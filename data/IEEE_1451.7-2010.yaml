abstract:
- content: Data formats designed to facilitate communications between radio frequency
    identification (RFID) systems and smart RFID tags with integral transducers (sensors
    and actuators) are introduced in this standard. New transducer electronic data
    sheet (TEDS) formats for smart RFID tags, based on the IEEE 1451 family of standards,
    are defined. Also, a comprehensive command set for smart RFID tags is defined.
