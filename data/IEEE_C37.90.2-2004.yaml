abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std C37.90.2-1995. Design tests for relay and relay systems
    that relate to the immunity of this equipment to Radiated Electromagnetic Interference
    from Transceivers are specified. Field strength, test frequencies, modulation,
    sweep rates, equipment setup and connection, test procedures, criteria for acceptance,
    and documentation for test results are described. This standards has been harmonized
    with IEC standards where consensus could be reached.
