abstract:
- content: The Management Information Base (MIB) module specifications for IEEE Std
    802.3TM, also known as Ethernet, are contained in this standard. It includes the
    Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2) MIB module specifications
    formerly produced and published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
    as well as extensions resulting from amendments to IEEE Std 802.3. The SMIv2 MIB
    modules are intended for use with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP),
    commonly used to manage Ethernet.
