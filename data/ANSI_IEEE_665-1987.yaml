abstract:
- content: Grounding practices that have generally been accepted by the electric utility
    industry as contributing to effective grounding systems for personnel safety and
    equipment protection in generating stations are identiÞed. A guide for the design
    of generating station grounding systems and for grounding practices applied to
    generating station indoor and outdoor structures and equipment, including the
    interconnection of the station and substation grounding systems, is provided.
