abstract:
- content: 'The methods that are used to measure telephone-set transmission performance
    may be divided into two classes: objective methods and subjective methods. The
    objective methods, which are those discussed in this standard, utilize a sound
    source resembling the human mouth to drive the transmitter, and an acoustic coupler
    resembling the human ear as a termination for the receiver. The sound source comprises
    a source of electrical energy and a moving-coil loudspeaker unit having supplementary
    electrical and acoustical components which produce a sound field simulating that
    of a typical human voice. This special loudspeaker is referred to as an artificial
    mouth. The acoustic coupler comprises a microphone and a terminating air volume
    having supplementary acoustic components which produce a load on the receiver
    simulating that of a typical human ear. This coupler is referred to as an artificial
    ear. The artificial mouth and ear are useful in comparing the performance of telephone
    sets at frequencies in the significant portion of the speech range.'
