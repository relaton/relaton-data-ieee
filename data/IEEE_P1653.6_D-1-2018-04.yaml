abstract:
- content: The grounding of dc equipment enclosures installed in dc traction power
    distribution facilities as well as related insulation treatments required for
    solid and resistance grounding methods are covered in this standard. Guidelines
    are also given for material, installation, and testing of insulation used in dc
    traction facilities and further recommended criteria for acceptability are provided.
    System grounding, though related, is not covered in this document.
