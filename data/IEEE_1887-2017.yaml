abstract:
- content: Traction power systems experience some of the most extreme variations in
    local power loads as compared to most other large scale electric power supply
    networks. These variations create challenges in the construction of reliable electric
    power delivery systems and in the performance of the rolling stock dependent on
    power supplied by the system. A solution is offered by energy storage by smoothing
    out these power variations, absorbing energy as system voltage rises, and delivering
    energy as voltage drops. Engineers are helped by this guide to identify where
    these solutions can provide the greatest benefits, design solutions with the greatest
    impact, and quantify the costs and benefits of deploying new solutions.
