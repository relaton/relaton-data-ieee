abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to establish uniform procedures for the
    measurement of radiation of radio noise from overhead power lines with meters
    that conform to American National Standards. A uniform procedure is a prerequisite
    to comparisons of radio-noise performance of various overhead power lines. The
    procedure applies in the frequency range of 0.015 to 30 MHz. A procedure for measurements
    in the frequency range of 20 to 1000 MHz, which is to be used only as a guide,
    is also presented.
