abstract:
- content: IEEE C57.121-1988, IEEE Guide for Acceptance and Maintenance of Less Flammable
    Hydrocarbon Fluid in Transformers, covers the evaluation and handling procedures
    for less flammable hydrocarbon transformer insulating fluids. Its purpose is to
    assist the transformer operator in receiving new fluids, filling transformers,
    and maintaining the fluids in serviceable condition.
