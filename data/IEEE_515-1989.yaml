abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 515-1989, IEEE Recommended Practice for the Testing, Design, Installation,
    and Maintenance of Electrical Resistance Heat Tracing for Industrial Application,
    provides the specific test requirements for qualifying electrical resistance heating
    cables for industrial service, and provides the basis for electrical and thermal
    design. Heater characteristics are addressed, and installation and maintenance
    requirements are detailed. Recommendations and requirements are made for unclassified,
    Class I, Division 2, and Class I, Division 1 heating cable applications.
