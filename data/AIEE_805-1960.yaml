abstract:
- content: The purpose of this procedure is to define uniform acceptable methods for
    making tests to determine the performance of alternating-current, 400-cycle-per-second,
    aircraft-type induction electric motors. Aircraft-type machines are subjected
    to environmental operating conditions much more stringent than those normally
    encountered by commercial type machines and yet minimum weight and the utmost
    reliability are essential to the application. Weight reduction is normally achieved
    by reduction of life expectancy, thus making direct measurements a necessity in
    order to determine that reliability is commensurate with aircraft practices. It
    is recognized that there may be acceptable methods for making tests other than
    those included herein. However, the methods in this publication are intended to
    serve as a standard for both manufacturers and users of aircraft motors. It is
    intended that the standardizing of test procedures will Iead to coincident test
    data regardless of which party conducts the test.
