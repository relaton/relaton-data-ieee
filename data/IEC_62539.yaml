abstract:
- content: This guide describes, with examples, statistical methods to analyze times
    to break down and breakdown voltage data obtained from electrical testing of solid
    insulating materials, for purposes including characterization of the system, comparison
    with another insulator system, and prediction of the probability of breakdown
    at given times or voltages.
