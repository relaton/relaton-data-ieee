abstract:
- content: A procedure to be used to perform a failure analysis is recommended. The
    procedure is primarily focused on power transformers used on electrical utility
    systems, although it may be used for an investigation into any ac transformer
    failure. This document provides a methodology by which the most probable cause
    of any particular transformer failure may be determined. This document is also
    intended to encourage the establishment of routine and uniform data collection
    procedures, consistency of nomenclature and compatibility with similar efforts
    by otherre organizations, and cooperative effects by users and manufacturers during
    the failure analysis.
