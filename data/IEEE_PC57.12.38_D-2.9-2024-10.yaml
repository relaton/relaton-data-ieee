abstract:
- content: Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are covered
    in this standard, and certain safety features of single-phase, 60-Hz, mineral-oil-immersed
    liquid-filled, self-cooled, pad-mounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers
    are taken into consideration. These transformers are rated 250 kVA and smaller,
    with high voltages of 34 500 GrdY/19 920 V and below, and with low voltages of
    480/240 V and below. These transformers are generally used for step-down purposes
    from an underground primary cable supply. The connector, bushing, and terminal
    arrangements for radial or loop feed systems are covered in this standard. The
    electrical and mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied
    with the transformer are not covered in this standard.
