abstract:
- content: This document defines recommended practices for conformity assessment procedures
    that should be used to verify plant-level conformity with IEEE Std 2800 for IBR
    plants interconnecting with a bulk power system. The document applies to IBRs
    in transmission and sub-transmission systems, as defined by the connecting utility.
    The document may also apply to isolated IBRs that are interconnected to an alternating
    current (AC) transmission system via dedicated voltage source converter high-voltage
    direct current (VSC-HVDC) transmission facilities, e.g., offshore wind farms.
    This recommended practice complements the IEEE 2800 test and verification framework
    with specifications for the equipment, conditions, tests, modeling methods, and
    other conformity assessment procedures that should be used to demonstrate conformance
    with IEEE 2800 technical minimum requirements for interconnection, capability,
    and performance of applicable IBRs.
