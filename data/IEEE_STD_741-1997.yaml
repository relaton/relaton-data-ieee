abstract:
- content: In this IEEE Standard, criteria that establish protection requirements
    for Class 1E power systems and equipment are prescribed. The purpose of and the
    means for obtaining protection from electrical and mechanical damage or failures
    that can occur within a time period that is shorter than that required for operator
    action are described. Testing and surveillance requirements are included. Plant
    physical design requirements to protect against certain events are not included.
