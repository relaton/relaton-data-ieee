abstract:
- content: This guide provides test procedures for evaluating the physical characteristics
    of cable cleaning solvents and their compatibility with extruded dielectric cable
    components and cable accessories (joints and terminations). Compatibility is established
    by placing component samples in contact with the cleaning solvent for a short
    period and then measuring the physical or electrical properties of the component.
    The measured values are compared with values for samples that have not been in
    contact with the cleaner. Suggested performance values are provided. The guide
    also provides suggested procedures for evaluating the cleaning effectiveness of
    cable cleaning solvents. These comparative test procedures do not provide absolute
    performance values.
