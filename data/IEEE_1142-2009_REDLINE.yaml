abstract:
- content: Detailed information relating to the design, testing, application and installation
    of various types of electrical cables in order to prevent the deleterious effect
    of moisture and chemical ingress and resultant failures in service is provided
    in this guide. This includes single and multi-conductor cables over a complete
    range of voltage ratings. Testing criteria and installation methods covered along
    with many technical references.
