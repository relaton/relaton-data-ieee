abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of communication between personal telehealth
    insulin pump devices and compute engines (e.g., cell phones, personal computers,
    personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play
    interoperability, is established in this standard. Appropriate portions of existing
    standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models, application
    profile standards, and transport standards are leveraged. The use of specific
    term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality
    in base frameworks in favor of interoperability are specified. A common core of
    communication functionality for personal telehealth insulin pump devices is defined.
    This standard corrects errors that have been identified in the IEEE Std 11073-10419-2015.
