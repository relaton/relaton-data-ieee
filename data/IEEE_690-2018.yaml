abstract:
- content: This standard provides direction for the design and installation of safety-related
    electrical cable systems, including associated circuits, in nuclear power generating
    stations. Also provided is guidance for the design, installation and performance
    requirements of those non-safety related cable systems that may affect the function
    of safety related systems. It provides guidance on applications of cable-penetration,
    fire stops, cable fire breaks, and cable-system enclosures for cable systems for
    Class 1E circuits.
