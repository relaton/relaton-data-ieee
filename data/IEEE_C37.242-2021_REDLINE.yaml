abstract:
- content: 'Guidance for synchronization, calibration, testing, and installation of
    phasor measurement units (PMUs) applied in power systems is provided. The following
    are addressed in this guide: (a) considerations for the installation of PMU devices
    based on application requirements and typical substation electrical bus configurations;
    (b) techniques focusing on the overall accuracy and availability of the time synchronization
    system; (c) test and calibration procedures for PMUs for laboratory and field
    applications; and (d) communications testing for connecting PMUs to other devices
    including phasor data concentrators.'
