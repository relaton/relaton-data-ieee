abstract:
- content: On-board devices/systems, with crashworthy memory, that record data to
    support accident/incident analysis for rail transit vehicles are covered. The
    requirements of this standard are limited to event recorder functions and interfaces.
    Data transmission methods are excluded. The information in this standard is independent
    of the hardware and/or software employed for other vehicle systems.
