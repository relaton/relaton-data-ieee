abstract:
- content: Methods for qualifying static battery chargers, inverters and uninterruptible
    power supply (UPS) systems for Class 1E installations outside containment in nuclear
    power generating stations are described in this standard. Similar electronic equipment
    for use in applications outside containment, where specific standards for such
    equipment are not available, may also be qualified using these methods. A combination
    of type testing and analysis, the latter including a justification of methods,
    theories, and assumptions used, are employed in the qualification methods set
    forth. Requirements of IEC/IEEE 60780-323 are met by these procedures.
