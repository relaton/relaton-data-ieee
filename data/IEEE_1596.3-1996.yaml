abstract:
- content: Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI), specified in IEEE Std 1596-1992, provides
    computer-bus-like services but uses a collection of fast point-to-point links
    instead of a physical bus in order to reach far higher speeds. The base specification
    defines differential ECL signals, which provide a high transfer rate (16 bits
    are transferred every 2 ns), but are inconvenient for some applications. IEEE
    Std 1596.3-1996, an extension to IEEE Std 1596-1992, defines a lower-voltage differential
    signal (as low as 250 mV swing) that is compatible with low-voltage CMOS, BiCMOS,
    and GaAs circuitry. The power dissipation of the transceivers is low, since only
    2.5 mA is needed to generate this differential voltage across a 100 W termination
    resistance. Signal encoding is defined that allows transfer of SCI packets over
    data paths that are 4-, 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-bits wide. Narrow data paths (4
    to 8 bits) transferring data every 2 ns can provide sufficient bandwidth for many
    applications while reducing the physical size and cost of the interface. The wider
    paths may be needed for very-high-performance systems.
