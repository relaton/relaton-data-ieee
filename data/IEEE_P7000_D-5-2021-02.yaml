abstract:
- content: A set of processes by which organizations can include consideration of
    ethical values throughout the stages of concept exploration and development is
    established by this standard. Management and engineering in transparent communication
    with selected stakeholders for ethical values elicitation and prioritization is
    supported by this standard, involving traceability of ethical values through an
    operational concept, value propositions, and value dispositions in the system
    design. Processes that provide for traceability of ethical values in the concept
    of operations, ethical requirements, and ethical risk-based design are described
    in the standard. All sizes and types of organizations using their own life cycle
    models are relevant to this standard.
