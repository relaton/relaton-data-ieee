abstract:
- content: Careful consideration of the physical and electrical characteristics of
    overhead lines and transmission cables are necessary in designing a transitio
    structure between the two systems. Environmental and social factors also play
    a role in designing a transition. By considering the factors contained in this
    Guide, the user will be better able to design a suitable transition that balances
    cost, operability, environmental factors, and future flexibility.
