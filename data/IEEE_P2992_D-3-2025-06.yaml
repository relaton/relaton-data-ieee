abstract:
- content: This document specifies the IEEE P2992 standard, which establishes recommended
    practices for data design in smart agriculture. It emphasizes standardized methods
    for data formats, tags, naming conventions, and transfer protocols to enable interoperability,
    scalability, and efficient data exchange between heterogeneous systems. These
    practices are pivotal for 4 integrating advanced technologies such as IoT, AI,
    and robotics into agricultural operations. The standard introduces hierarchical
    and unified data structures, supporting both real-time streaming and batch processing.
    It defines techniques for data tagging, ensuring semantic clarity, granularity,
    and contextual relevance, alongside robust naming rules to help prevent conflicts
    and enhance reusability. Data exchange protocols such as MQTT, HTTP/HTTPS, and
    CoAP are supported, promoting flexibility across various platforms. Additionally,
    the document highlights methods for data encapsulation, enabling compatibility
    with proprietary and standardized formats using MIME and JSON. It includes guidelines
    for data storage in file systems, JSON databases, and key-value stores, enhancing
    adaptability to diverse operational requirements. Applications of this standard
    span the digital transformation of agriculture, including precise environmental
    monitoring, growth analysis, and market-responsive crop management. Use cases
    illustrate JSON-based data representations for crops, showcasing efficiency gains
    in data size and actionable insights. By implementing IEEE P2992, stakeholders
    in the agricultural ecosystem can achieve improved productivity, data-driven decision-making,
    and seamless collaboration across systems and manufacturers.
