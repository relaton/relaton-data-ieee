abstract:
- content: This standard provides guidance to users of IEEE standards as to how to
    meet the quality management expectations of ISO 9001:2000 clauses and subclauses
    in a software development context by adopting ISO/IEC 90003 (the software development
    guidance document for ISO 9001) and adding an informative annex to cross-reference
    IEEE S2ESC standards to relevant ISO 9001 material. This standard is identical
    to ISO/IEC 90003 but contains an additional informative annex, Annex C, cross-referencing
    material in ISO 9001 with material in S2ESC standards that could be helpful in
    meeting the intent of ISO 9001, as well as a second additional annex, Annex D,
    which is a bibliography of the specific IEEE standards referenced.
