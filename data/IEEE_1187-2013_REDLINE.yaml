abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides guidance for the installation and installation
    design of valve-regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries. This recommended practice
    is intended for all standby stationary installations. However, specific applications,
    such as emergency lighting units and semi-portable equipment, may have other appropriate
    practices and are beyond the scope of this recommended practice. Alternative energy
    applications are not covered.
