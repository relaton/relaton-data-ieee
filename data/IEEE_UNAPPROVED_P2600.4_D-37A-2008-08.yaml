abstract:
- content: Standard for a Protection Profile for Hardcopy Devices in a small, private
    information processing environment in which most elements of security are provided
    by the physical environment, but basic network security is needed to protect the
    device and its network from misuse from outside of the environment. Small offices
    and home offices are typical applications of this environment. This environment
    will be known as "Operational Environment D."
