abstract:
- content: A test procedure (Combination of IEEE Std 275&#8482;-1992 and IEEE Std
    429&#8482;-1994) for comparing two or more insulation systems in accordance with
    their expected life at rated temperature is outlined. The procedure is limited
    to insulation systems for alternating-current (ac) electrical machines using form-wound
    pre-insulated stator coils rated 15000 V and below
