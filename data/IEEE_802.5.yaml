abstract:
- content: 'This amendment to Local and Metropolitan Area Network standard, ISO/IEC
    8802-5 : 1998, is part of a family of local area network (LAN) standards dealing
    with the physical and data link layers as defined by the ISO/IEC Open Systems
    Interconnection Basic Reference Model. The requirements for dedicated token ring
    (DTR) operation are specified, including the changes and additions to the Medium
    Access Control (MAC) layer to provide for an additional full-duplex mode of operation
    (switching), and for interconnection of shared LAN segments to switch ports. Also
    specified are the characteristics of a fibre optic interface for connecting a
    4 Mbit/s or 16 Mbit/s token ring station to the trunk coupling unit (TCU) of a
    token ring, including station, port, and channel requirements. Fibre optic trunk
    signaling recommendations are also made.'
