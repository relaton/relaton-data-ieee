abstract:
- content: Since World War II, radar systems engineers have used letter designations
    as a short notation for describing the frequency band of operation. This usage
    has continued throughout the years and is now an accepted practice of radar engineers.
    Radar-frequency letter designations are used for given reasons. The radar letter
    designations are consistent with the recommended nomenclature of the International
    Telecommunications Union (ITU). The high frequency (HF) and the very high frequency
    (VHF) definitions are identical in the two systems. The essence of the radar nomenclature
    is to subdivide the existing ITU bands, in accordance with radar practice, without
    conflict or ambiguity.
