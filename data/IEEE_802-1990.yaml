abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 802-2001 This IEEE Standards product is part of
    the 802 family on LAN/MAN. This document provides an overview to the family of
    IEEE 802 Standards, defines compliance with the family of IEEE 802 Standards,
    describes the relationship of the IEEE 802 Standards to the Open Systems Interconnections
    Basic Reference Model [ISO 7498:1984] and explains the relationship of these standards
    to the higher layer protocols, and provides a standard for identification of public,
    private, and standard protocols.
