abstract:
- content: This standard is the second generation of IEEE std 1857.2-2013 [IEEE Standard
    for Advanced Audio Coding], which provides more flexible and high efficiency coding
    tool sets for compression, decompression, and packaging of the audio data, which
    should double the coding efficiency of IEEE std 1857.2-2013. The target applications
    and services include but are not limited to the audio accompanying video and other
    audio services and applications, such as the audio accompanying Internet video,
    TV audio system, digital audio storage, audio broadcasting and communication,
    virtual reality and panoramic audio, etc.
