abstract:
- content: These recommended practices provide direction for establishing procedures
    that will yield data which verify that the class 1E equipment can meet its performance
    requirements during and following on SSE (safe shutdown earthquake) preceded by
    a number of OBEs (operating basis earthquakes). This document maybe used by equipment
    manufactures to establish procedures that will yield data to substantiate performance
    claims or by equipment users to evaluate and verify performance of representative
    devices and assemblies as part of an overall qualification effort.
