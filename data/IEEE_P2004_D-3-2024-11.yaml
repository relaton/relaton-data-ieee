abstract:
- content: This document provides recommendation for the user to design, establish,
    and execute real-time based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setups and includes analytical
    frameworks referred to stability, accuracy, and sensitivity assessment as well
    as experimental case studies. Additional informative material is provided in the
    annexes.
