abstract:
- content: The purpose of this amendment is to improve the IEEE 802.11 wireless local
    area network (WLAN) user experience by providing significantly higher basic service
    set (BSS) throughput for existing WLAN application areas and to enable new market
    segments for operation below 6 GHz including distribution of multiple multimedia/data
    streams.
