abstract:
- content: A framework with TIPPSS principles (trust, identity, privacy, protection,
    safety, and security) for Clinical Internet of Things (IoT) data and device interoperability
    is established in this standard. This includes wearable clinical IoT and interoperability
    with healthcare systems including electronic health records (EHR), electronic
    medical records (EMR), other Clinical IoT devices, in-hospital devices, and future
    devices and connected healthcare systems.
