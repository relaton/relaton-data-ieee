abstract:
- content: '" Realistic and repeatable criteria, as well as recommended test methods,
    for characteriz-ing the absorption properties of typical anechoic chamber linings
    applied to a metallic surface aredescribed. Parameters and test procedures are
    described for the evaluation of RF absorbers to beused for radiated emissions
    and radiated susceptibility testing of electronic products, in the ab-sorber manufacturer
    and/or absorber user environment, over the frequency range of 30 MHz to5 GHz."'
