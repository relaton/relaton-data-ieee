abstract:
- content: This test procedure is intended to give a direct evaluation of the composite
    insulation system of an oil-immersed distribution transformer, tested as an integral
    unit. It is to be noted that the oil in which the transformer is immersed is to
    be considered a part of the insulation system. It is the intent of the procedure
    to provide that each component of the insulation structure operate during the
    test under conditions which are, as nearly as possible, the same as those that
    it would encounter in service. Thus, it is intended that each component be evaluated
    in accordance with its actual function.
