abstract:
- content: The IEEE Property Specification Language (PSL) is defined in this standard.
    PSL is a formal notation for specification of electronic system behavior, compatible
    with multiple electronic system design languages, including IEEE Std 1076trade
    (VHDL<sup>reg</sup>), IEEE Std 1364trade (Verilog<sup>reg</sup>), IEEE P1666trade
    (SystemC<sup>reg</sup>), and IEEE P1800trade (SystemVerilog<sup>reg</sup>), thereby
    enabling a common specification and verification flow for multi-language and mixed-language
    designs. PSL captures design intent in a form suitable for simulation, formal
    verification, formal analysis, and hybrid verification tools. PSL enhances communication
    among architects, designers, and verification engineers to increase productivity
    throughout the design and verification process. The primary audiences for this
    standard are the implementors of tools supporting the language and advanced users
    of the language.
