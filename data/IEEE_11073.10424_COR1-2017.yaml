abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of the communication between sleep apnoea
    breathing therapy equipment (SABTE) devices (agents) and managers (e.g., cell
    phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set-top boxes), in a manner
    that enables plug-and-play interoperability, is established in IEEE Std 11073-10424-2014.
    It leverages appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073
    terminology, information models, application profile standards, and transport
    standards. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors
    in telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor
    of interoperability. IEEE Std 11073-10424-2014 defines a common core of communication
    functionality for SABTE. In this context, SABTE is defined as a device that is
    intended to alleviate the symptoms of a patient who suffers from sleep apnoea
    by delivering a therapeutic breathing pressure to the patient. SABTE is primarily
    used in the home health-care environment by a lay operator without direct professional
    supervision. This corrigendum corrects errors that have been identified in IEEE
    Std 11073-10424-2014 to make it easier to implement the standard in an interoperable
    fashion.
