abstract:
- content: Circuitry that may be built into an integrated circuit to assist in the
    test, maintenance and support of assembled printed circuit boards and the test
    of internal circuits is defined. The circuitry includes a standard interface through
    which instructions and test data are communicated. A set of test features is defined,
    including a boundary-scan register, such that the component is able Circuitry
    that may be built into an integrated circuit to assist in the test, maintenance
    and support of assembled printed circuit boards and the test of internal circuits
    is defined. The circuitry includes a standard interface through which instructions
    and test data are communicated. A set of test features is defined, including a
    boundary-scan register, such that the component is able to respond to a minimum
    set of instructions designed to assist with testing of assembled printed circuit
    boards. Also, a language is defined that allows rigorous structural description
    of the component-specific aspects of such testability features, and a second language
    is defined that allows rigorous procedural description of how the testability
    features may be used.
