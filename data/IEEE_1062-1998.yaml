abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1062, 1998 Edition (R2002), Includes IEEE Std 1062-1993 and IEEE
    Std 1062a-1998. A set of useful quality practices that can be selected and applied
    during one or moresteps in a software acquisition process is described. This recommended
    practice can be applied tosoftware that runs on any computer system regardless
    of the size, complexity, or criticality of thesoftware, but is more suited for
    use on modified-off-the-shelf software and fully developed software.
