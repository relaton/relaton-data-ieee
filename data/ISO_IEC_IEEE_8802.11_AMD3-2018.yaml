abstract:
- content: The IEEE 802.11 directional multi-gigabit (DMG) physical layer (PHY) and
    the medium access control (MAC) layer are modified by this amendment to IEEE Std
    802.11-2016 to enable operation in the Chinese millimeter wave frequency band
    around 60 GHz. This amendment also defines modifications to the IEEE 802.11 PHY
    and MAC layer to enable operation in the Chinese millimeter wave frequency band
    around 45 GHz.
