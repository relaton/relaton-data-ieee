abstract:
- content: A normative definition of communication between personal telehealth International
    Normalized Ratio (INR) devices (agents) and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal
    computers, personal health appliances, and set top boxes) is established in this
    standard in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. Work done in
    other ISO/IEEE 11073 standards is leveraged, including existing terminology, information
    profiles, application profile standards, and transport standards. The use of specific
    term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality
    in base frameworks in favor of interoperability is specified. A common core of
    functionality of INR devices is defined in this standard. In the context of personal
    health devices, the measurement of the prothrombin time (PT) that is used to assess
    the level of anticoagulant therapy and its presentation as the International Normalized
    Ratio compared to the prothrombin time of normal blood plasma is referred to in
    INR monitoring. Applications of the INR monitor include the management of the
    therapeutic level of anticoagulant used in the treatment of a variety of conditions.
    The data modeling and its transport shim layer according to ISO/IEEE 11073-20601:2010
    are provided by this standard, and the measurement method is not specified.
