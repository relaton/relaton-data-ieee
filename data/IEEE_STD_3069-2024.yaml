abstract:
- content: 'The test indicators (including the definition and description of the indicators
    and the explanation of the equation), requirements (the range of the test results),
    and methods (test environment) are described in this recommended practice, as
    well as the test steps for each indicator of the six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF)
    active infrared optics augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) handheld-controller
    space tracking technology. Based on the product usage scenarios of the AR/VR handheld-controller,
    the test indicators are mainly divided into three categories: dynamic scene test,
    static scene test, and extreme scene test, including the following:-Dynamic scene
    test, simulating the actual user’s handheld-controller interaction scene: The
    corresponding tests include absolute position/rotation error, translation/rotation
    resolution, tracking system latency, and tracking range.-Static scene test, testing
    the space tracking performance of the handheld-controller when it is stationary:
    The corresponding tests include static position jitter and angle drift, maximum
    translation jitter, and pose sampling frequency.-Extreme scene test, corresponding
    to the handheld-controller space tracking capability in extreme scenes: The corresponding
    tests include maximum ambient light intensity, minimum number of cameras, and
    time delay of tracking lost/recover.'
