abstract:
- content: An architecture framework description for the Internet of Things (IoT)
    which conforms to the international standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 is defined.
    The architecture framework description is motivated by concerns commonly shared
    by IoT system stakeholders across multiple domains (transportation, healthcare,
    Smart Grid, etc.). A conceptual basis for the notion of things in the IoT is provided
    and the shared concerns as a collection of architecture viewpoints is elaborated
    to form the body of the framework description.
