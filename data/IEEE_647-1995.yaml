abstract:
- content: The specification and test requirements for a single-axis laser gyro for
    use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement measuring systems,
    and angular rate measuring systems is defined. A standard specification format
    guide for the preparation of a single-axis laser gyro is provided. A complication
    of recommended procedures for testing a laser gyro, derived from those presently
    used in the industry, is also provided.
