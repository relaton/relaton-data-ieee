abstract:
- content: 'Original scope: The IEEE 1076 language has been primarily designed for
    the description and the simulation of digital hardware systems. As such, it provides
    only limited capabilities when used in analog modeling. VHDL 1076.1 aims to enhance
    VHDL 1076 such that it can support the description and simulation of circuits
    and systems that exhibit continuous behavior over time and over amplitude. The
    revision will correct editorial errors and clarify aspects of the language definition
    in the original document, and will update the document to reflect changes in the
    VHDL 1076 specification.'
