abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides 1 considerations for the pre-installation,
    installation, inspection, and testing of Class 1E power, instrumentation, and
    control equipment and systems of a nuclear facility while in the process of installing,
    inspecting, and testing during new construction, modification, or maintenance.
    This recommended practice does not apply to periodic testing. For purposes of
    this standard, in addition to a nuclear power plant, a nuclear facility is defined
    as a facility related to the nuclear fuel cycle from fuel processing to reprocessing
    and waste facitilies.
