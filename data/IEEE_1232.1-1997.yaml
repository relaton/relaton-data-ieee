abstract:
- content: Formal models for information used in system diagnosis are defined. As
    part of the AI-ESTATE set of standards, this standard includes several models
    that form the basis for a format to facilitate exchange of persistent diagnostic
    information between two reasoners, and also provides a formal typing system for
    the services defined in the AI-ESTATE service specification.
