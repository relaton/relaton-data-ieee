abstract:
- content: A framework that can be used to create a national or an organizational
    NIST-traceable measurement quality assurance (MQA) program that will optimize
    the quality of radioassays performed by service laboratories is presented. This
    standard serves as a guide for MQA programs developed for specialized sectors
    of the radioassay laboratory community, i.e., bioassay, routine environmental
    monitoring, environmental restoration and waste management, radiopharmaceuticals,
    nuclear power radiochemistry, and other areas involved in radioassays.
