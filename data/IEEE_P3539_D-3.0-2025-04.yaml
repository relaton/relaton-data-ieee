abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the composition, technical requirements, test methods,
    and related requirements for the labeling, packaging, transportation, and storage
    of the refueling robot system. The refueling robot system supports functions such
    as vehicle guidance, parking assistance, environmental perception, and safety
    assistance. It is capable of autonomously opening and closing the car's fuel tank
    and providing automatic refueling services.
