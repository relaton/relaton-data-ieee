abstract:
- content: Since 1999, test methods for freezing conditions, including ice and snow,
    have been refined by the IEEE Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society and
    IEEE Power and Energy Society Task Forces on insulator icing. In this guide, the
    discussion is consolidated, and specific, appropriate, and reproducible test methods
    for selecting adequate insulators are recommended. Test methods for substation
    and line insulators at distribution and transmission voltage levels are included
    in the scope. Special measures to reproduce the environmental and insulator parameters
    that influence the risk of flashover in freezing conditions are detailed in the
    test methods. Statistical methods are also recommended to assist in the insulator
    selection process.
