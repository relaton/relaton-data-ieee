abstract:
- content: This recommended practice is intended to serve in the preparation of standards
    that are principally concerned with the thermal endurance of electrical insulating
    materials and simple combinations of such materials, the establishment of limiting
    temperatures of electrical Insulation systems, and the provision of general principles
    for thermal classification of electrical insulation systems
