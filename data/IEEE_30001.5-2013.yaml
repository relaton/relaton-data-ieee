abstract:
- content: The selection and application of power distribution apparatus used in industrial
    andcommercial power systems are covered in this recommended practice. It is likely
    to be of greatestvalue to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience
    with this equipment. It can also bean aid to all engineers responsible for the
    electrical design of industrial and commercial powersystems.
