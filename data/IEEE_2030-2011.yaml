abstract:
- content: 'IEEE Std 2030 provides alternative approaches and best practices for achieving
    smart grid interoperability. It is the first all-encompassing IEEE standard on
    smart grid interoperability providing a roadmap directed at establishing the framework
    in developing an IEEE national and international body of standards based on cross-cutting
    technical disciplines in power applications and information exchange and control
    through communications. IEEE Std 2030 establishes the smart grid interoperability
    reference model (SGIRM) and provides a knowledge base addressing terminology,
    characteristics, functional performance and evaluation criteria, and the application
    of engineering principles for smart grid interoperability of the electric power
    system with end-use applications and loads. A system of systems approach to smart
    grid interoperability lays the foundation on which IEEE Std 2030 establishes the
    SGIRM as a design tool that inherently allows for extensibility, scalability,
    and upgradeability. The IEEE 2030 SGIRM defines three integrated architectural
    perspectives: power systems, communications technology, and information technology.
    Additionally, it defines design tables and the classification of data flow characteristics
    necessary for interoperability. Guidelines for smart grid interoperability, design
    criteria, and reference model applications are addressed with emphasis on functional
    interface identification, logical connections and data flows, communications and
    linkages, digital information management, and power generation usage.'
