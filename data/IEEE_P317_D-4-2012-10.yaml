abstract:
- content: An electric penetration assembly is an assembly of insulated electric conductors,
    conductor seals, module seals (if any), and aperture seals that provides the passage
    of the electric conductors through a single aperture in the nuclear containment
    structure, while providing a pressure barrier between the inside and the outside
    of the containment structure. The electric penetration assembly includes terminal
    (junction) boxes, terminal blocks, connectors and cable supports, and splices
    which are designed and furnished as an integral part of the assembly. This standard
    prescribes the requirements for the design, construction, qualification, test,
    and installation of electric penetration assemblies in nuclear containment structures
    for stationary nuclear power generating stations. This standard presents criteria
    to facilitate the determination of the features of design, construction, test,
    qualication and installation relative to the electric penetration assemblies of
    primary containments of the nuclear facilities that comply with the United States
    Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Code of Federal Regulations (10CFR50).
