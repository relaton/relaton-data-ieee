abstract:
- content: Assistance in selecting the most appropriate type of low-voltage component
    surge-protective device (gas tube, air gap, metal-oxide varistor, or avalanche
    junction semiconductor) for a particular application is provided. Evaluation of
    the characteristics of each device to meet specific service requirements is also
    given.
