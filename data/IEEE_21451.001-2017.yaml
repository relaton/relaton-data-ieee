abstract:
- content: Signal processing algorithms and data structure are defined in this recommended
    practice in order to share and to infer signal and state information of an instrumentation
    or control system. These algorithms are based on the signal and transducers attached
    to the system. This recommended practice also defines a set of transducer signal
    treatment services based on signal treatment algorithms as application programming
    interface (API), which is used for applications to use or call these transducer
    signal treatment services.
