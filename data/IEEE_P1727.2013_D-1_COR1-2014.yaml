abstract:
- content: This guideline establishes induced voltage working procedures for underground
    transmission circuits. A transmission circuit when de-energized will have an induced
    voltage when in a common duct bank with an energized circuit. The induced voltage
    may be a possible safety hazard. The induced voltage may be determined by modeling
    the circuits and by measurement. This guide addresses the working procedures to
    follow when performing work where induced voltage is present.
