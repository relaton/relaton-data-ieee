abstract:
- content: This standard defines a method to validate computational electromagnetics
    computer modeling and simulation techniques, codes, and models. It is applicable
    to a wide variety of electromagnetic applications including but not limited to
    the fields of electromagnetic compatibility, radar cross section, signal integrity,
    and antennas. Validation of a particular solution data set can be achieved by
    comparison to the data set obtained by measurements, alternate codes, canonical,
    or analytic methods.
