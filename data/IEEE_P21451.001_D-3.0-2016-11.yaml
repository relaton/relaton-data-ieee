abstract:
- content: IEEE P21451-001 defines signal processing algorithms and data structure
    in order to share and to infer signal and state information of an instrumentation
    or control system. These algorithms are based on the signal and transducers attached
    to the system. order to share and to infer signal and state information of an
    instrumentation or control system. These algorithms are based on the signal and
    transducers attached to the system. This standard also defines a set of transducer
    signal treatment services based on signal treatment algorithms as application
    programming interface (API), which is used for applications to use or call these
    transducer signal treatment services.
