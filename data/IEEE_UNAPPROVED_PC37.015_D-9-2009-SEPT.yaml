abstract:
- content: Guidance for the application of ac high-voltage circuit breakers for shunt
    reactor switching is provided. Overvoltage generation for the three cases of shunt
    reactors being either directly grounded, ungrounded, or grounded through a neutral
    reactor is addressed in terms of derivation and limitation methods. Circuit breaker
    specification for the purpose and the use of laboratory test results to predict
    field performance is also covered by this guide.
