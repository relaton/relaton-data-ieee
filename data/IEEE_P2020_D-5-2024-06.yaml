abstract:
- content: Some of the fundamental attributes that contribute to image quality for
    automotive applications are addressed in this standard. Existing metrics and other
    information relating to these attributes are also identified, as well as a standardized
    suite of objective test methods for measuring automotive camera image quality.
    In addition, baseline test methods and relevant information about tools available
    to facilitate standards-based communication, as well as a comparison of performance
    among vehicle manufacturers, system integrators, and component vendors regarding
    automotive image quality, are outlined.
