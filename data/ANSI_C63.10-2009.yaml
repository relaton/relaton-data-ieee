abstract:
- content: 'This standard is intended to cover procedures for testing the compliance
    of a wide variety of unlicensed wireless devices (also called unlicensed intentional
    radiators) including but not limited to: remote control and security unlicensed
    wireless devices, frequency hopping and direct sequence spread spectrum devices,
    anti-pilferage devices, cordless telephones, medical unlicensed wireless devices,
    Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure devices, intrusion detectors, unlicensed
    wireless devices operating on frequencies below 30 MHz, automatic vehicle identification
    systems, and other unlicensed wireless devices authorized by a radio regulatory
    authority. The test procedures for new technology wireless devices will be added
    to future editions of this standard as soon as practical after consensus is achieved
    for compliance testing methods of the new devices. However, this standard excludes
    test procedures for unlicensed wireless devices already covered in other published
    standards, e.g., Unlicensed Personal Communication Services (UPCS) devices.'
