abstract:
- content: This guide is intended to apply to silicone-immersed transformers for which
    the silicone liquid was the liquid supplied when the transformer was originally
    manufactured. It does not address transformers that have been retro-filled. The
    theory of combustible gas generation in a silicone-filled transformer, recommended
    procedures for sampling and analysis, recommended actions based on the interpretation
    of results, and a bibliography of related literature are addressed in this guide.
