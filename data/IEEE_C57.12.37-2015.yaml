abstract:
- content: A basis for the electronic reporting of transformer test data on liquid
    immersed distribution transformers, as defined in the IEEE C57.12.2X, C57.12.3X,
    and C57.12.4X standards series, is provided in this standard. The specific set
    of test data to be reported, and the report format, is detailed along with an
    extended set of data as an option for the user.
