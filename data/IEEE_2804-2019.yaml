abstract:
- content: This standard is intended primarily for tool developers and hardware developers
    who would use Software Hardware Interface for Multi-Many-core (SHIM) to exchange
    hardware description for software tools. It also attempts to provide software
    developers with insights into what hardware information is described in SHIM to
    foster understanding of the intention and the extent of SHIM.
