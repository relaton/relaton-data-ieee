abstract:
- content: This standard applies to high-potential testing of complete excitation
    systems and their components of synchronous machines. The components of the excitation
    system are described in IEEE Std 421-1972, Criteria and Definitions for Excitation
    Systems for Synchronous Machines. Also included are auxiliary devices that are
    exposed to excitation system stresses. Examples of such auxiliary devices are
    temperature indicators, transducers, meters, etc.
