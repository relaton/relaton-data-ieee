abstract:
- content: Graphic symbols for representing logic functions or physical devices capable
    of carrying out logic functions are presented. Descriptions of logic functions,
    the graphic representation of these functions, and examples of their applications
    are provided. The symbols are presented in the context of electrical applications,
    but most may also be applied to nonelectrical systems (for example, pneumatic,
    hydraulic, or mechanical). The supplement provided additional internationally
    approved graphic symbols and made corrections as needed to IEEE Std 91-1984.
