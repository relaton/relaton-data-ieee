abstract:
- content: Covered in this guide is the application of surge protective devices (SPD)
    and surge protective circuits (collectively called surge protectors) used to protect
    information and communication technology (ICT) circuits, including smart grid.
    This guide is not intended to cover individual surge protective components. Specifically
    excluded from this guide are stand-alone ac power protectors.
