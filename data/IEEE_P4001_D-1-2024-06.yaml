abstract:
- content: This standard defines performance characteristics for hyperspectral imaging
    devices, usually referred to as hyperspectral cameras or imagers, as well as metadata
    for hyperspectral images, for a set of use cases defined to represent a wide range
    of applications. In the context of this standard, a hyperspectral camera or data
    set is defined as one in which pixel spectra are measured over a specified spectral
    range without gaps and with a spectral sampling interval not exceeding 1/30 of
    the spectral range. The standard considers cameras operating in the spectral range
    from 250 to 2500 nm wavelength, and applies to a defined set of hyperspectral
    camera architectures. Camera characteristics are defined to cover all key aspects
    of camera performance. Within the applicable camera architectures, the characteristics
    are defined so as to be directly comparable between cameras. Metadata are defined
    for describing camera-related aspects of a hyperspectral image, which can aid
    information extraction in the subsequent exploitation of the image.
