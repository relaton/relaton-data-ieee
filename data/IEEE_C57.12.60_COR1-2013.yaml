abstract:
- content: This corrigendum clarifies temperature control for aging experiments in
    4.5.1 that was a result of the combination of the two previous test standards.
    This corrigendum selects the method from the two which should have been used in
    the combined test standard represented by the 2009 version. This document also
    makes one minor editorial change in 4.4.
