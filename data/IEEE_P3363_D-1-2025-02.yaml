abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the data unit format for use by Internet of Things
    (IoT) power sensors. The data format describes the exchange of service data, control
    data, and fragmented data via the IEC 61850/IEC 60870-104 or Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol. Wireless Internet of Things (IoT) power sensors that
    communicate via air interface protocols may be used with this standard. Power
    automation systems for power system applications are addressed by this standard.
    Furthermore, wireless IoT power sensors to efficiently exchange information and
    to monitor the status of power transmission and transformation equipment are enabled
    by this standard. Guidance in the design, development, and testing of integrated
    applications of related systems and devices is provided in this standard. Specifically,
    unified coding rules and a lightweight and scalable data unit format for the status
    parameters of power transmission and transformation equipment, which shorten the
    length of data packets and reduce the power consumption of wireless IoT power
    sensors, are provided by this standard.
