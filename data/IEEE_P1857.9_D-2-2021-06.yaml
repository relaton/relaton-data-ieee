abstract:
- content: Efficient coding tool sets for compression, decompression, and reconstructing
    of the immersive visual content data is provided. The target applications and
    services include, but are not limited to, virtual reality (VR), such as unmanned
    aerial vehicle-based VR, augmented reality, panorama video, free-view TV, panoramic
    stereo video, and other video-/audio-enabled services and applications, such as
    immersive video streaming, broadcasting, storage, and communication.
