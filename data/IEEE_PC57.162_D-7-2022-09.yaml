abstract:
- content: It is widely accepted that one of the most significant contaminants affecting
    the performance of liquid immersed transformers is moisture. Because of its importance,
    many standards and guides give various descriptions of the effects of moisture,
    various recommendations on the acceptable levels of moisture, recommendations
    for the determination of moisture and moisture mitigation techniques. This guide
    is intended to consolidate available state-of-the-art knowledge for moisture related
    parameters in liquid immersed transformers and to serve as a reference that other
    standards and guides can refer to.
