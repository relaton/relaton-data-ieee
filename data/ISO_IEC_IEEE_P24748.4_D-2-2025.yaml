abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle
    processes, provides a common process framework covering the life cycle of human-made
    systems, from the conception of ideas through to the retirement of a system. It
    provides the processes for acquiring and supplying systems. In addition, this
    framework provides for the assessment and improvement of the life cycle processes.
    This common framework improves communication and cooperation among the parties
    that create, utilize, and manage modern systems in order that they can work in
    an integrated, coherent fashion. The acquisition or supply of a system is usually
    done within a project. A project prepares and implements the technical planning,
    resources and schedules necessary to guide the project toward accomplishment of
    its objectives and proper conclusion. The project’s authorization and objectives
    are documented in an information item identified as a Systems Engineering Management
    Plan (SEMP). This document defines a SEMP as the key vehicle for representing
    a project's application of systems life cycle processes. In this document, the
    terms technical planning and systems engineering planning are used interchangeably
    to emphasize or differentiate technical contributions in the processes under discussion.
