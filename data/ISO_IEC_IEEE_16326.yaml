abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326:2009 provides normative content specifications for project
    management plans covering software projects, and software-intensive system projects.
    It also provides detailed discussion and advice on applying a set of project processes
    that are common to both the software and system life cycle as covered by ISO/I
    EC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008) and ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std 152882008),
    respectively. The discussion and advice are intended to aid in the preparation
    of the normative content of project management plans. ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326:2009
    is the result of the harmonization of ISO/IEC TR 16326:1999 and IEEE Std 1058-1998.
