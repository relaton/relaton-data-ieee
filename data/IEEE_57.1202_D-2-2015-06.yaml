abstract:
- content: This standard covers the requirements for phase-shifting transformers of
    all types. The scopeexcludes transformers with a fixed unregulated phase shift.This
    standard is limited to matters particular to phase-shifting transformers and does
    notinclude matters relating to general requirements for power transformers covered
    in existingstandards in the IEC 60076 series or IEEE C57.12.00 and IEEE C57.12.10.
