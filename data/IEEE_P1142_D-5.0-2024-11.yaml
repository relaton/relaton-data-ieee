abstract:
- content: This guide provides detailed information relating to the design, testing,
    application and installation of various types of electrical cables in order to
    reduce the deleterious effect of moisture and chemical ingress and resultant failures
    in service. This includes single and multiconductor cables over a complete range
    of voltage ratings. Testing criteria and installation methods covered along with
    many technical references.
