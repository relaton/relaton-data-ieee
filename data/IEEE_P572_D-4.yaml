abstract:
- content: This standard provides criteria for qualification of commonly- used Class
    1E connection assemblies for service in nuclear power generating stations. The
    proposed revision will address (1) current qualification methodology and technologies,
    (2) digital technology effects on connector qualification, (3) EMI/RFI environmental
    factors, and (4) consistency with IEEE Std 323-2004.
