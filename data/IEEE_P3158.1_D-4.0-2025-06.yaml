abstract:
- content: This standard specifies performance and test requirements, procedures,
    and acceptance criteria for a trusted data matrix system. Based on consensus-made
    requirements, agreements and management tools, a trusted data matrix is a data
    and resource sharing digital infrastructure to facilitate trusted, secure, transparent,
    and accountable data sharing, exchanging, circulation and trading among different
    stakeholders.
