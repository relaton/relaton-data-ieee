abstract:
- content: Recommended practices for evaluating and measuring the performance of IEEE
    Std 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) devices and networks at the component
    and application level are described. A set of performance metrics, measurement
    methodologies and test conditions are provided that enable such measurements to
    be made and permit prediction of the performance of installed WLAN devices and
    networks.
