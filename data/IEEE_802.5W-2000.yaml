- content: Withdrawn September 2008. This corrigendum to Local and Metropolitan Area
    Network standards, IEEE Std 802.5, 1998 Edition and IEEE Stds 802.5r and 802.5j,
    1998 Edition, is part of a family of local area net-work (LAN) standards dealing
    with the physical and data link layers as defined by the ISO/IEC Open Systems
    Interconnection Basic Reference Model. Errors that have been identified in the
    two standards are corrected.
