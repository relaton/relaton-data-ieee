abstract:
- content: Recommendations and guidance for distributed resources (DR) interconnected
    on the distribution secondary networks, including both spot networks and grid
    networks, are provided. This document gives an overview of distribution secondary
    network systems design, components, and operation; describes considerations for
    interconnecting DR with networks; and provides potential solutions for the interconnection
    of DR on network distribution systems. lEEEStd 1547.6-2011 is part of the IEEE
    1547&#x2122; series of standards. IEEE Std 1547-2003 provides mandatory requirements
    for the interconnection of DR with EPSs and focuses primarily on radial distribution
    circuit interconnections. For DR interconnected on networks, all of IEEE Std 1547-2003
    needs to be satisfied. IEEE Std 1547.6-2011 was specifically developed to provide
    additional information in regard to interconnecting DR with distribution secondary
    networks.
