abstract:
- content: 'The document provides guidance for synchronization, calibration, testing,
    and installation of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) applied in power system protection
    and control. The following are addressed in this guide: (a) Considerations for
    the installation of PMU devices based on application requirements and typical
    bus configurations. (b) Techniques focusing on the overall accuracy and availability
    of the time synchronization system. (c) Test and calibration procedures for laboratory
    and field applications. (d) Communications testing for connecting PMUs to other
    devices including Phasor Data Concentrators (PDC).'
