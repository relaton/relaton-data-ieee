abstract:
- content: This standard applies to metal-oxide surge arresters designed to repeatedly
    limit the voltage surges on 48 Hz to 62 Hz power circuits (>1000 V) by passing
    surge discharge current and automatically limiting the flow of system power current.
    This standard applies to devices for separate mounting and to those supplied integrally
    with other equipment. The tests demonstrate that an arrester can survive the rigors
    of reasonable environmental conditions and system phenomena, while, at the same
    time, protect equipment and/or the system from damaging overvoltages caused by
    lightning, switching, or other undesirable surges.
