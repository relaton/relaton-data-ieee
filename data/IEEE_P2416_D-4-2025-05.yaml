abstract:
- content: This standard describes a parameterized and abstracted power model enabling
    system, software, and hardware IP-centric power analysis and optimization. It
    defines concepts for the development of parameterized, accurate, efficient, and
    complete power models for systems and hardware IP blocks usable for system power
    analysis and optimization. These concepts include, but are not limited to, process,
    voltage and temperature (PVT) independence, power and thermal management interface,
    and workload and architecture parameterization.
