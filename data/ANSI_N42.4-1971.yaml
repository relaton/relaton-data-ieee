abstract:
- content: Coaxial high-voltage connectors on nuclear instruments for DC applications
    up to 5000 V and AC applications up to 3500 V rms at 60 Hz are covered. The connectors
    may also be used at higher frequencies provided the operating voltage is appropriately
    reduced to provide for interchangeability of safe high-voltage connectors in nuclear
    instrument applications. The connectors are safe in that the pin and socket contacts
    are well and securely recessed in the connector housing so that hand or body contact
    of the unmated connector with rated voltage applied will not result in electrical
    shock. You will receive an email from Customer Service with the URL needed to
    access this publication online.
