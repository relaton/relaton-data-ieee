abstract:
- content: This is a standard for short range, wireless communication in the vicinity
    of, or inside, a human body (but not limited to humans). It uses existing ISM
    bands as well as frequency bands approved by national medical and/or regulatory
    authorities. Support for quality of service, extremely low power, and data rates
    up to 10 Mbps is required while simultaneously complying with strict non-interference
    guidelines where needed. This standard considers effects on portable antennas
    due to the presence of a person (varying with male, female, skinny, heavy, etc.),
    radiation pattern shaping to minimize specific absorption rate into the body,
    and changes in characteristics as a result of the user motions.
