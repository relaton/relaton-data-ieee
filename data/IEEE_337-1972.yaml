abstract:
- content: This specification defines the requirements for a linear, single-axis,
    pendulous, analog torque balance accelerometer. The instrument is equipped with
    a permanent magnet torquer and is used as a sensing element to provide an electrical
    signal proportional to acceleration. The torque balance electronics are not considered
    to be part of the instrument.
