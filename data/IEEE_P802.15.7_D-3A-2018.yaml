abstract:
- content: A physical layer (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) sublayer for short-range
    optical wireless communications (OWC) in optically transparent media using light
    wavelengths from 10 000 nm to 190 nm are defined. The standard is capable of delivering
    data rates sufficient to support audio and video multimedia services and also
    considers mobility of the optical link, compatibility with various light infrastructures,
    impairments due to noise and interference from sources like ambient light, and
    a MAC sublayer that accommodates the unique needs of visible links as well as
    the other targeted light wavelengths. It also accommodates optical communications
    for cameras where transmitting devices incorporate light-emitting sources and
    receivers are digital cameras with a lens and image sensor. The standard adheres
    to applicable eye safety regulations.
