abstract:
- content: This standard defines a defect coverage accounting method based on simulation
    models for defects observed within integrated circuits (ICs). The portion of a
    defect universe, comprising thousands or millions of reasonably likely defects,
    that is detected or “covered” by tests of analog and mixed-signal circuits depends
    on many factors, which this standard considers, such as detectability, process
    variations, defect characteristics, and redundancy. The contents of a defect coverage
    summary are specified, and dozens of commonly used terms are clearly defined,
    to aid communication about the quality of tested ICs
