abstract:
- content: This recommended practice covers the protection of conductors used in industrial
    and commercial power systems. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented
    engineer with limited experience in the area of protection and control. It can
    also be an aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial
    and commercial power systems.
