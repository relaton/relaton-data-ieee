abstract:
- content: The maximum Powered Device (PD) power available is increased by this amendment
    to IEEE Std 802.3-2018 by utilizing all four pairs in the specified structured
    wiring plant. This represents a substantial change to the capabilities of Ethernet
    with standardized power. The power classification information exchanged during
    negotiation is extended to allow meaningful power management capability. These
    enhancements solve the problem of higher power and more efficient standardized
    Power over Ethernet (PoE) delivery systems.
