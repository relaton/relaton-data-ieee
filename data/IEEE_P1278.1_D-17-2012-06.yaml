abstract:
- content: Data messages, known as Protocol Data Units (PDUs), that are exchanged
    on a network amongsimulation applications are defined. These PDUs are for interactions
    that take place within specifieddomains called protocol families, which include
    Entity Information/Interaction, Warfare, Logistics, SimulationManagement, Distributed
    Emission Regeneration, Radio Communications, Entity Management, Minefield,Synthetic
    Environment, Simulation Management with Reliability, Information Operations, Live
    EntityInformation/Interaction, and Non-Real-Time protocol.
