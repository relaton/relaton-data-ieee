abstract:
- content: This guide provides a summary of the methods for detection, mitigation,
    and control of concentric neutral corrosion in medium-voltage, unjacketed, underground
    distribution cable installed direct buried or in conduit. The causes of corrosion
    in cable concentric neutral wires and straps and the methods available to detect
    this corrosion are described. The purpose of the concentric neutral and the consequences
    of significant loss of the concentric neutral are discussed. Recommendations are
    made for the mitigation and control of the cable concentric neutral corrosion.
