abstract:
- content: Surge-protective components (SPCs) used in power and telecom surge-protective
    devices (SPDs) and equipment ports are covered in the C62.42 guide series. This
    Overview part covers protective functions, both non-linear and linear; component
    technologies and characteristics; common circuit designs used in SPDs and equipment
    ports; and information on the impulse (surge) generators used to test SPCs. Additional
    parts of C62.42 on specific SPC technologies provide details on component construction,
    characteristics and ratings, and application examples.
