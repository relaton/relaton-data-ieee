abstract:
- content: The application of tertiary and stabilizing windings in liquid-immersed
    power transformers, as covered by IEEE Std C57.12.00&#8482;, as well as recommendations
    to evaluate the need or convenience of having such windings, are addressed in
    this guide. The primary application of this guide is for transformers and autotransformers
    with wye-wye-connected windings, with or without a delta-connected tertiary or
    stabilizing winding. Tertiary windings in conventional delta-wye and delta-delta&#8211;connected
    transformers are not addressed by this guide.
