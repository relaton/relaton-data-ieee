abstract:
- content: This standard defines ANSI Standard Real-Time BASIC, in which the declarations
    and real-time statements are defined for use with CAMAC hardware. It covers real-time
    capabilities, declarations, parallel activities, CAMAC input and output, the CAMAC
    Q and X signals, CAMAC LAM handling, message passing, shared data, and bit manipulation.
    The aim is to achieve maximum compatibility between different implementations
    of ANSI BASIC for use with CAMAC.
