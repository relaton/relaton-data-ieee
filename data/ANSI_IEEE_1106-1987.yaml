abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 1106-1995. Maintenance procedures, capacity test
    schedules, and capacity testing procedures that can be used to optimize the life
    and performance of nickel-cadmium batteries designed for continuous-float applications
    are provided. Guidance for determining when these batteries should be replaced
    is also given. Sizing, installation, qualification, other battery types, and application
    are not considered.
