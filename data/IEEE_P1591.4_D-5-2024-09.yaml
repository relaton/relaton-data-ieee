abstract:
- content: The performance, test requirements, procedures, and acceptance criteria
    for the hardware of a transmission line overhead conductor with optical fibers
    commonly known as optical phase conductor (OPPC) are covered. Functional requirements,
    such as electrical, mechanical, optical fiber, environmental, and test requirements
    related to design, installation, in service, and maintenance, including routine
    tests, are included.
