abstract:
- content: Minimum functional and design criteria for the power, instrumentation,
    and control portions of nuclear power generating station safety systems are established
    in this standard. The criteria are to be applied to those systems required to
    protect the public health and safety by functioning to mitigate the consequences
    of design basis events. The intent is to promote safe practices for design and
    evaluation of safety system performance and reliability. Although the standard
    is limited to safety systems, many of the principles may have applicability to
    equipment provided for safe shutdown, post accident monitoring display instrumentation,
    preventative interlock features, or any other systems, structures, or equipment
    related to safety.
