abstract:
- content: Recommendations are given for reactors intended for series connection,
    in both transmission and distribution systems, to control power flow under steady-state
    conditions and/or limit fault current under short-circuit conditions. Dry-type
    air-core reactors covered by this standard are self-cooled by natural air convection.
    Other reactors, including filter reactors, shunt capacitor reactors (used with
    shunt capacitor banks), and discharge current-limiting reactors (used with 5 series
    capacitor banks) and AC-side converter reactors are also covered.
