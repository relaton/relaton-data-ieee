abstract:
- content: In an increasingly connected digital environment, the management of identity
    relationships between users, artificial intelligence systems, smart devices, and
    sensors has become critical. The standard provides a comprehensive framework for
    managing such relationships and managing application data access using identity
    relationships, emphasizing data interoperability, security, and regulatory compliance.
    By establishing clear protocols for data access, privacy, and integration with
    third-party utilities, the standard aims to provide accurate, secure, and transparent
    handling of identity relationships and the flow of data between different identity
    relationships. As the digital ecosystem evolves, the standard emphasizes the importance
    of adaptability, urging regular updates based on technological advancements and
    emerging challenges.
