    The standard identifies the need for comprehensive plan for effective digital
    transformation that addresses the people element, the process element, and the

    The people element addresses leadership and workforce management issues associated
    with organizational change management. The process section discussed the impact
    on business processes. In addition, this section addresses application of business
    process changes in different types of business operations. The technology section
