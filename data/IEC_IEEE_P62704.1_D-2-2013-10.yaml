abstract:
- content: The scope of this standard is to define the methodology for the application
    of the finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique when used for determining
    the peak spatial-average specific absorption rate (SAR) in the human body exposed
    to wireless communication devices with known uncertainty. It defines methods to
    validate the numerical model of the device under test (DUT) and to assess its
    uncertainty when used in SAR simulations. Moreover, it defines procedures to determine
    the peak spatial average SAR in a cubical volume and to validate the correct implementation
    of the FDTD simulation software. This document will not recommend specific SAR
    limits since these are found elsewhere, e.g., in the guidelines published by the
    International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) or in IEEE
    C95.1.
