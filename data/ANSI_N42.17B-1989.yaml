abstract:
- content: ANSI N42.17B-1989, American National Standard Performance Specifications
    for Health Physics Instrumentation-Occupational Airborne Radioactivity Monitoring
    Instrumentation, describes the minimum acceptable performance criteria for instrumentation
    used to monitor occupational exposure to airborne radioactive materials. Included
    in the standard are testing methods to establish the acceptability of each air
    monitor. Tests involve air sampling capability; power, electronic, and alarm capabilities;
    radiation and interfering responses; and environmental factors including temperature,
    humidity, and ambient pressure.
