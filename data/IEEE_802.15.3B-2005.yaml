abstract:
- content: This amendment provides corrections and optimizations to IEEE Std 802.15.3-2003.
    The management service access points (SAPs) have been completely updated to create
    a consistent, logical interface. As a consequence, most of the message sequence
    charts (MSCs) in the medium access control (MAC) functional specification have
    been updated as well. Channel time usage is more efficient with the addition of
    multiple contention periods, releasing channel time, implied acknowledgment, and
    mullticast groups. (The PDF of this standard is available at no cost.
