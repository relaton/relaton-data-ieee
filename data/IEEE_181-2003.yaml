abstract:
- content: This standard presents approximately 100 terms, and their definitions,
    for accurately and precisely describing the waveforms of pulse signals and the
    process of measuring pulse signals. Algorithms are provided for computing the
    values of defined terms that describe measurable parameters of the waveform, such
    as transition duration, state level, pulse amplitude, and waveform aberrations.
    These analysis algorithms are applicable to two-state waveforms having one or
    two transitions connecting these states. Compound waveform analysis is accomplished
    by decomposing the compound waveform into its constituent two-state single-transition
    waveforms.
