abstract:
- content: Software verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes, which determine
    whether development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of
    that activity, and whether the software satisfies its intended use and user needs,
    are described. This determination may includeanalysis, evaluation, review, inspection,
    assessment, and testing of software products andprocesses. V&amp;V processes assess
    the software in the context of the system, including the operational environment,
    hardware, interfacing software, operators, and users.
