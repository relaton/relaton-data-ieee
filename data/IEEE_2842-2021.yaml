abstract:
- content: 'Data has become one of the most important assets in ICT area. Secure multi-party
    computation plays a very important role in balancing data usage and data protection.
    It could build trust and security in data collaboration and big data analysis
    related areas. A technical framework for secure multi-party computation is provided
    in this standard, including specifying the following: an overview of secure multi-party
    computation; a technical framework of secure multi-party computation; security
    levels of secure multi-party computation; and use cases based on secure multi-party
    computation.'
