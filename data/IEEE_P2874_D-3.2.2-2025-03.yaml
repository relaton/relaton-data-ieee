abstract:
- content: 'This standard describes the services, hypergraphs, protocols, and languages
    that enable interoperable, semantically compatible connections between network-connected
    hardware (e.g. autonomous drones, sensors, loT devices, robots) and software (e.g.
    user agents, services, platforms, applications, artificial intelligence systems)
    and includes specifications for: ⎯a functional layer stack capable of fulfilling
    spatially defined real-world and virtual requests for digital content respectful
    of governance authorities and self-sovereign identity ⎯a spatial range query and
    response format for requesting content or data about assets within a dimensional
    range ⎯a data ontology for describing objects, relationships, and activities ⎯a
    verifiable credentialing and certification method for permissioning create-retrieve-update-delete
    access to devices, locations, users, and data ⎯a human and machine-readable contracting
    language that enables the expression and automated execution of legal, financial,
    and physical activities This standard is identical in content to a base document
    developed by the Spatial Web Foundation and provided to the lEEE P2874 Spatial
    Web, Architecture and Governance Working Group for standardization.'
