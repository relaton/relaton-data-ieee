abstract:
- content: POSIX.1-2008 is simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1&#8482;-2008 and The Open
    Group Technical Standard Base Specifications, Issue 7. This 2013 Edition includes
    IEEE Std 1003.1-2008/Cor 1-2013 incorporated into IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (the base
    document). The Technical Corrigendum addresses problems discovered since the approval
    of IEEE Std 1003.1-2008. POSIX.1-2008 defines a standard operating system interface
    and environment, including a command interpreter (or “shell”), and common utility
    programs to support applications portability at the source code level. POSIX.1-2008
    is intended to be used by both application developers and system implementors
    and comprises four major components (each in an associated volume).
