abstract:
- content: 'Design tests for relays, relay systems, and control devices used for protection
    and control of electric power apparatus that relate to the immunity of this equipment
    to repetitive electrical transients are specified in this standard. Two types
    of tests are specified: the slow damped oscillatory test, and the electrical fast
    transient (EFT ) burst test. For devices with communication ports, where the device
    does not perform protection or control functions, testing of the communication
    functions is covered by IEEE Std 1613&#8482;. Where the device performs protection
    or control functions and has communication ports, tests for all communication
    functions are covered by this document. For devices without communication ports,
    the tests are covered by this document.'
