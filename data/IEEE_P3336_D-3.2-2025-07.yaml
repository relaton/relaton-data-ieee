    criteria of vibration tests for aircraft warning marker balls on overhead transmission
    lines are provided in this guide. The guide applies to aircraft warning marker
    balls used on overhead transmission lines, especially on the long span transmission
    lines which cross over a river or sea or on the transmission lines above 500 kV.
