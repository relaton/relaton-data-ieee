abstract:
- content: Superseded. This guide contains information and recommendations for applying
    audio tones over telephone channels for power system relaying. Included are sections
    on transmitting and receiving equipment, leased telephone channels, application
    principles, installation, and testing. Reflected in this work is the knowledge
    and experience of equipment manufacturers and telephone companies as well as that
    of power utility users. This guide is not intended to supplant specific or general
    instructions contained in the manufacturers' instruction books or in any contractual
    agreement between a manufacturer or telephone company(s) or both and a purchaser
    of a given relaying system. The illustrations in 5.7 are used for illustrative
    purposes only and do not represent the preferred protection under all conditions.
