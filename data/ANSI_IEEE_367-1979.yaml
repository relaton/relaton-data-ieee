abstract:
- content: Difficulties are experienced by telecommunication and protective relay
    engineers in determining the maximum power station ground potential rise, or induced
    voltages, or both. Suitably rated protective devices are required for personnel
    safety and for the protection and continuity of service of wire line telecommunication
    facilities entering electrical power stations, or otherwise exposed to the influence
    of electrical power circuits. This guide provides guidance for the calculation
    of these maximum voltages and for the acceptance of values lower than maximum,
    as well as the time requirements of communication channels where protective relaying
    is involved.
