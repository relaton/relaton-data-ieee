abstract:
- content: Uniform procedures for the measurement of the power frequency electric
    field and dc electric field when ac/dc power transmission lines are installed
    in parallel or on shared towers are established in this recommended practice.
    The measurement ranges and layout of measurement points, data recording and processing,
    and result evaluation methods of parallel power transmission lines of different
    voltage levels are recommended.
