abstract:
- content: The basic purpose of IEEE 127 is to serve as a guide to show preferred
    (steady-state) frequency and voltage ratings for primary power systems. A careful
    study, was accomplished by the Flight Vehicle Systems Integration Subcommittee.
    The attached tabulation gives recommended standard frequencies and voltages for
    all types of aerospace electric apparatus for which standards appear practical.
