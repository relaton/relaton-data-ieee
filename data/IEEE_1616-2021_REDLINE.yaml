abstract:
- content: Export data related to motor vehicle pre-defined events in usage history
    is collected, recorded, stored, and exported by motor vehicle event data recorders
    (MVEDRs). A protocol for MVEDR output data compatibility and export protocols
    of MVEDR data elements is defined by this standard. A motor vehicle event data
    recorder connector lockout apparatus (MVEDRCLA) and a near field communication
    (NFC) protocol is defined for safeguarding access to a vehicle’s event data recorder
    (EDR) data by securing the vehicle output diagnostic link connector (DLC) and
    establishing a chain of custody link. This standard is without prejudice to requirements
    of national or regional laws related to privacy, data protection, and personal
    data processing.
