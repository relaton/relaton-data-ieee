abstract:
- content: This standard is intended to aid the electric power industry in reporting
    and evaluating electric generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity.
    This standard was developed to overcome present difficulties in the interpretation
    of electric generating unit performance data from various systems and to facilitate
    comparisons among different systems. It should also make possible the future exchange
    of meaningful data among systems in the United States, Canada, and throughout
    the world.
