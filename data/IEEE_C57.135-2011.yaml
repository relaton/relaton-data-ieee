abstract:
- content: Theory, application of phase-shifting transformers, and the difference
    of specification and testing to standard system transformers are described in
    this guide. Various types of phaseshifting transformers and how to select the
    optimal design to achieve required control of power flow are covered. An understanding
    of the terminology, types, construction, and testing specific to phase-shifting
    transformers is provided.
