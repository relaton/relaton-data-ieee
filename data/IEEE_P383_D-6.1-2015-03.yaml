abstract:
- content: This standard provides general requirements and methods for qualifying
    electric cables, and splices for nuclear facilities. Cable, wire, and splices
    within or integral to other devices (e.g., instruments, panels, motors, etc.)
    should be qualified using the requirements in the applicable device standard or
    IEEE Std 323TM. However, this standard's requirements may be applied to the cable,
    wire and splices within these devices. For qualification of fiber optic cable
    refer to IEEE Std 1682TM.
