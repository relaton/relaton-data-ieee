abstract:
- content: 'This document provides a set of critical considerations to be addressed
    at key points in the life cycle of systems created by humans. This document refers
    to a constituent system that will interact in a system of systems as the system
    of interest (SOI). These considerations are aligned with ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and
    the ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748 framework for system life cycle stages and associated terminology.
    Selected subsets of these considerations may be applied throughout the life of
    systems. This is accomplished through the involvement of all stakeholders with
    the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction by ensuring that when delivered,
    the system will operate effectively in the operational or business environment
    which will typically be characterized as one or more systems of systems. This
    document concerns those systems that are man-made and are configured with one
    or more of the following: hardware, software, humans, procedures and facilities.'
