abstract:
- content: Guidance for improving the security auditability and traceability of blockchain-based
    federated machine learning is provided in this document. Blockchain-based federated
    machine learning helps data owners, producers, consumers, and collaborators to
    realize multi-party secure computing while meeting applicable interaction, decentralization,
    safety, reliability, and robustness guidelines. Blockchain-based Federated Machine
    Learning can improve the privacy of data owners, producers, consumers, and collaborators,
    and enable those entities to give permission for functions including the use of
    data, withdrawing the use of data, and potentially selling data under specified
    conditions.
