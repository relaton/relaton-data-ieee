abstract:
- content: 'This document provides standard and recommended practices for ensuring
    the quality of measured data for high frequency electrical interconnect at frequencies
    up to 50 GHz. This might include but is not limited to: recommended design of
    test fixtures, methods and processes for ensuring the accuracy and consistency
    of measured data for signals with frequency content up to 50 GHz. The standard
    and general practice should be applicable for frequencies higher than 50 GHz as
    well. The methods and techniques contained herein have been validated only to
    50 GHz as of this writing.'
