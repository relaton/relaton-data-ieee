abstract:
- content: Design, manufacturing, and testing unique to the application of thyristor
    controlled power rectifiers for dc supplied transportation substation applications
    up to 1500 V dc nominal output is covered in this recommended practice. Both forward
    rectifier with power flow from ac to dc, and reversible rectifiers with bidirectional
    power flow are included; traction power substation rectifiers that are to be provided
    as part of a rectifier transformer unit or are provided separately are intended
    to be addressed. Application information and extensive definitions of related
    technical terms are included.
