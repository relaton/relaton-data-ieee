abstract:
- content: How all or part of a network can be secured transparently to peer protocol
    entities that use the MAC Service provided by IEEE 802(R) LANs to communicate
    is specified in this standard. AC security (MACsec) provides connectionless user
    data confidentiality, data frame integrity, and data origin authenticity. (The
    PDF of this standard is available at no cost compliments of the IEEE GET program
    at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=68)
