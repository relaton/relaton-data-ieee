abstract:
- content: This guide is primarily concerned with the grounding system design for
    photovoltaic solar power plants that are utility owned and/or utility scale (5
    MW or greater). The focus of the guide is on differences in practices from substation
    grounding as provided in IEEE Std 80. This guide is not intended for the substations
    to interconnect the plant; however, if the substation is included within the plant,
    portions of this guide may be applicable. Similarly, this guide does not directly
    cover small scale solar power plants (such as rooftop type systems), substation
    grounding, or lightning protection.
