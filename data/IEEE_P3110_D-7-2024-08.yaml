abstract:
- content: Functional and technical requirements for the interfaces between algorithms
    and learning frameworks (including the interfaces provided by training frameworks),
    and between algorithms and data sets in the development of artificial intelligence
    (AI) computer vision algorithms are specified in this standard. The adaptation
    and invocation of the application programming interfaces (API) involved in the
    development of computer vision algorithms (CVA) based on deep learning (hereinafter
    referred to as “CVA”) is addressed in this standard.
