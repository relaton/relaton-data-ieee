abstract:
- content: Guidance and references are provided by this recommended practice for the
    design, manufacture, testing and selection of oil-immersed on-load capacity switching
    distribution transformers with rated frequency of 50 Hz/60 Hz, voltages of 10
    kV or below, and rated capacity of 750 kVA and below. On-load capacity switching
    distribution transformers are transformers with two rated capacities and equipped
    with additional components to control the operating capacity for energy saving
    purposes.
