abstract:
- content: The necessary information content and recommended organization for a software
    design description are specified. A software design description is a representation
    of a software system that is used as a medium for communicating software design
    information. The recommendations, which may be applied to commercial, scientific,
    or military software that runs on any digital computer, are not limited to specific
    methodologies for design, configuration management, or quality assurance, or to
    any particular descriptive technique. Applicability is not restricted by the size,
    complexity, or criticality of the software.
