abstract:
- content: For dc power transmitters of wireless charging for kitchen appliances,
    a definition of wireless power supply kitchen system, typical structure, interface
    and key component, function requirements, and performance requirements are established
    in this standard. Specific term codes and formats are specified. Behaviors of
    dc wireless transmitters in kitchen environments, limits of the optional parameters,
    and topology in the basic electrical framework are discussed.
