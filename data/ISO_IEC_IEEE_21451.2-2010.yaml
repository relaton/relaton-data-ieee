abstract:
- content: A digital interface for connecting transducers to microprocessors is defined.
    A TEDS and its data formats are described. An electrical interface, read and write
    logic functions to access the TEDS and a wide variety of transducers are defined.
    This standard does not specify signal conditioning, signal conversion, or how
    the TEDS data is used in applications.
