abstract:
- content: Sound is generated by a high-voltage reactor during operation due to vibration
    with the action of electrical and mechanical stress. Rich state information about
    the reactor is contained in these sound signals. Therefore, the evaluation of
    equipment status can be aided by the measurement and research into reactor sound
    signals. A solid technical foundation for locating abnormal noise in reactors
    is also provided by the development of acoustic imaging technology. Acoustic imaging
    technology allows researchers to obtain the distribution of the sound field of
    a reactor with a microphone array. Combined with knowledge of the reactor structure
    and operating status, the position of a sound signal and the status of reactors
    can be effectively determined by researchers with this technology. The characteristics
    of acoustic imaging technology include noncontact measurement, simple operation,
    and flexible arrangement. The measured results are important for diagnosing reactor
    status and identifying sound sources. To guide and provide instructions for the
    testing of on-site acoustic imaging for reactors, this guide is formulated to
    specify the test methods, provide the basic requirements, and describe the test
    instruments, procedures, test data analysis methods, and data records, while providing
    guidance for the testing of acoustic imaging for reactor.
