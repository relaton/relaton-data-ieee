abstract:
- content: This standard specifies extensions to IEEE Std 1149.1 that define the boundary-scan
    structures and methods required to facilitate boundary-scan-based stimulus of
    interconnections to passive and/or active components. Such networks are not adequately
    addressed by existing standards, including those networks that are AC-coupled
    or differential. The selective AC stimulus generation enabled by this standard,
    when combined with non-contact signal sensing, will allow testing of the connections
    between devices adhering to this standard and circuit elements such as series
    components, sockets, connectors, and integrated circuits that do not implement
    IEEE Std 1149.1. This standard also specifies Boundary-Scan Description Language
    (BSDL) extensions to IEEE Std 1149.1 required to describe and support the new
    structures and methods.
