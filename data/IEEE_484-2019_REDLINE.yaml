abstract:
- content: Recommended design practices and procedures for storage, location, mounting,
    ventilation, instrumentation, preassembly, assembly, and charging of vented lead-acid
    batteries are provided. Required safety practices are also included. These recommended
    practices are applicable to all stationary applications. Specific applications,
    such as emergency lighting units, semiportable equipment, and alternate energy
    applications, may have other appropriate practices and are beyond the scope of
    this recommended practice.
