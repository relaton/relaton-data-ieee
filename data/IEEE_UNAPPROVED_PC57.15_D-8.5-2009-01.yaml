abstract:
- content: Description of design types, tables of 50 and 60 Hz ratings, supplementary
    ratings, construction and available accessories are provided. Methods for performing
    routine and design tests applicable to liquid-immersed single and three-phase
    step-voltage regulators are described. This standard covers resistance measurements,
    polarity tests, power factor and megger tests, ratio tests, no load loss and excitation
    current measurements, impedance and load loss measurements, dielectric tests,
    temperature tests, routine and design impulse tests, short-circuit tests, control
    tests, calculated data and certified test data.
